US,B07R295MLS,R10F8H5QY4W3TI,"(tldr)First impression, big fan of this bot. Compact and convenient 👍",Style: 11S Max,"I needed a vacuum for my small room to pick up all the dust and dog, and because I like good air flow I need to vacuum a lot but didn't like it taking up my time. I like that you can manual control where it goes if you want it to hit a specific spot and that your not tied down with wifi. I was a little nervous that the docking station needed more room, bit conveniently fits under a chair. First use had no issues and it did pick up dust and pet hair with ease.",是,5,"Martinez, Rudy",2025-02-21
US,B07R295MLS,R3QD43MCT3DZX7,GREAT,Style: 11S Max,I got this for my dad for Xmas. He has had NO complaints. I started with the lower tier one just in case we disliked it but I definitely want to eventually upgrade it. It’s very durable and can maneuver around the house well. It got stuck in bathroom once because it started cleaning in there with the door half open. It has a good suction too and cleans the carpet just as well as our other vacuum did. It takes longer than if we manually vacuumed but it is also more thorough and well we aren’t the one doing the work lol,是,5,Amieisole,2025-02-20
US,B07R295MLS,R3H8392NP95J2Q,Very effective and easy to use,Style: 11S Max,"My husband and I were impressed at its ability to both vacuum and navigate our rather complex floor plan with different types of rugs and tiles. I really appreciate that I can turn it on and it hasn't gotten stuck anywhere. It's suction power is amazing, especially in getting cat hair and small crumbs. Unlike other types we own, I don't need to frequently get up for it to function - thus defeating the idea of a ""robot"".
<br>From my experience, this inexpensive no frills vacuum is more effective than my other brand 10x its price and 100x harder to to use.

US,B07R295MLS,R2NMUDC5PLNTE3,Good little robot vacuum,Style: 11S Max,"Set-up was easy; I programmed it to run during the night, so we wouldn’t trip over it, and it works. It does occasionally get caught under furniture (sofa, specifically), and when that happens, the battery runs down. It recharges quickly, though, and the bin is easy to empty. I empty the bin in the morning, put it back on the charger, and it’s good to go. It helps with day-to-day floor maintenance, and so far, so good.",是,5,C. D. Cook,2025-02-19
US,B07R295MLS,R1UOQIJOIMYO5S,Less than two weeks old and already has issues,Style: 11S Max,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;I’m not sure where to start.
<br>It does pick up dirt off the floor and pet hair, but not leaves.
<br>I have multiple rooms. Sometimes it leaves the room sometimes it doesn’t.
<br>I haven’t even had this two weeks and you can see in the video, it’s already squeaking.
<br>When it puts itself in a position like up underneath a recliner for instance, it basically just kind of Scoots back-and-forth and stays there until it runs out of power. So if you’re not monitoring this thing, it won’t get much done.
<br>I don’t buy my appliances to have to stand over them and make sure they’re doing their job. They are supposed to alleviate some of my work.
<br>I used to have a Roomba and I could easily use it. Let it charge and do that 3 to 4 times in a day.
<br>You won’t do that with this because it takes hours to charge.
<br>Also, as you’re looking through the specifics on this item as you scroll down, it shows the vacuum with the spinning brush on both sides. That is not the case. It only has one spinning brush on one side.
<br>It was quieter than my previous Roomba until it started squeaking and it doesn’t bang off of things as loud, but it needs a lot more attention and it seems like it’s going to break down fairly quick.
<br>I had such high hopes.
<br>Sadly, I will be returning it.",是,2,Venie,2025-02-19

<br>
<br>The problems: This is the second model of this product we purchased. 1st product was purchased 11/2020; it lasted approx 2.5 years before it stopped functioning. The power light would simply flash yellow and beep no longer vacuuming. A battery replacement did not remedy the issue. We got it for a good price and decided we'd purchase the same model again. That was a mistake. Our next unit last 13 months (conveniently just beyond the 12mo warranty) before it started spinning in circles. We contacted Eufy; they said it was the bumper and sent a replacement bumper but this did not remedy the problem. We contacted Eufy again, they responded with a generic 'it's out of warranty and not our problem'. Poor support from my perspective and the product did not last. I'd stay away even at a ridiculously good price. 2 Eufys; 2 rounds of wasted money.",是,2,Krista Gattis,2025-02-17

US,B07R295MLS,R13FJLI50I2AFS,EUFY Robot Vacuum Good N Bad,Style: 11S Max,"We've had our new Eufy Robot Vacuum for almost two months now and here are some comments, both good and not so good. We have had a previous robot vacuum for several years with a good experience.
<br>
<br>We purchased this Eufy Robot two months ago and it is quite. Way more quite than the previous brand we owned, (except when it squeaks). We run it daily throughout our 1500 sq ft home and it does a super job of picking up dirt. Our home is tile with a few throw rugs and the Eufy does not miss a beat when passing from tile to the rugs. We clean the Eufy rotating brush and debris container every day. We live in a desert area, so there is daily dirt tracking into our home.
<br>
<br>The only issue we have with this Eufy is the SQUEEK/CHIRPING noise it makes about 75% of the time. And boy is this annoying! This squeak happens at a rate of twice a SECOND, and will go on for up to 15 minutes at a time. I have removed the side brush and rotating brush as a test and the squeak still happens. So it is something inside the case making the noise. Some days it will vacuum for two hours and not make a squeak, other days, it squeaks for 15 mins, then runs quiet for 5 mins then starts squeaking again. The squeak is totally random. It happens on the rug and tile both. It is driving us nuts and is loud enough that it cannot be ignored.
<br>
<br>We are retired and living on limited income, so it's not like we're just going to go buy another robot vacuum. These type vacuums are a real benefit to those of us that getting a bit older and have some difficulty with daily cleaning. I just wish this unit didn't SQUEEK! I guess it's time for some ear plugs.",是,3,DesertBoot,2025-02-13
US,B0DCFNZF32,RD1N9L6LELRUA,Was so excited but now not so much,Style: Omni C20,After returning another brand I bought and really looking forward to this one after reading reviews and seeing videos and comments. But I’ve had just at a week and have tried several days in row to do my house. Not a large house but all hardwood. I leave off doing rooms not used and closets etc and still no luck getting a full clean for living/kitchen/2 small bathrooms/master and laundry room. I’m not having luck. It gets stuck on my vents and battery dies quick and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I was so excited and really thought it was going to be amazing since my floors always look dirty due to 2 pets and dark hardwood floors. Instead it looks dirtier and I have to be home to get anything done because at work it send notice stuck and battery dead could not go back to base etc etc … I’m going to give more time before returning and I’ve taken pics but so far I’m so disappointed because the one I bought and returned (different brand) mopping sucked but never got stuck and did fabulous job on vacuum. Keep in mind these are not cheap purchases!!! Maybe I’ll be able to update in week or so like another review I read did but for now not so much,是,3,Mindi S.,2025-02-13
US,B0DCFNZF32,R1CJD21V3CAW5,Water tank issue,Style: Omni C20,I have had this unit for a few months now. It worked incredible when it did work. As of now it will not suck the dirty water into the tank rendering the mop function useless. Eufy knows of this problem as they sent out an updated dirty water tank (5 weeks later) for free. Stuck the new tank in today and it still is doing the same thing. I’m extremely disappointed and I’m out over $300. Stay away from Eufy and get a Roborock.,是,1,Steven,2025-02-13

I have owned and gifted quite a few of these. I believe everyone should have a robot vacuum at home and this brand has a great cost effective product. You’ll need to move things, keep cords and random stuff off the floor, empty the canister regularly and clean the brushes, but once you have it all figured out, your floors will be clean! It will clean under your couch, bed, end tables etc. You’ll also get to play a fun game of hide and seek in the rare event that the eufy gets lost and can’t find its way back to its charging port.

US,B07R295MLS,RUOX82DFL9KTT,I wanted to like this vacuum,Style: 11S Max,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;Within one week of having this vacuum, it had stopped working properly. First, it struggled to return itself home, as you can see in my in my video. It would do this until I physically turned it off and placed it on its home base. It would also randomly beep and error code stating there was a low charge, and it never ran for more than 60 minutes, where as it's advertised runtime is 100 minutes. Also, it is a poor design and I wouldn't recommend it for pet owners, It was unable to vacuum hair, instead it all got tangled on its rotating brush, so I found myself giving it a daily haircut. Even with all of that aside, it ultimately spent more time vacuuming the same areas of my rooms 3-4x before it would even make it's first pass on a different area, or it would be confused and trying to turn itself around. I am not one to leave reviews, but I thought it would be worth it for people to know what they may be paying for.

US,B07R295MLS,R6XCZZSGXS05A,11S MAX works well but only has 1 brush,Style: 11S Max,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;Overall I’m meh with this product. It cleans well and runs for a long time (the ad says it runs for 100 minutes on hardwood floors, which is all I have). I did an expirament where I swept and mopped the areas it would cover, then ran the vacuum. It was gross to see what it picked up and I missed.
<br>
<br>The two things I’m not happy about is that 1) it takes forever to charge and 2) there is only one brush. All the other eufy vacuums I’ve had there are two brushes, one on each side. I feel like this makes it less effective. The pictures don’t show the underside so I wasn’t aware. The ad also says it has “infrared-sensor for evading obstacles” which it does not. It bumps into everything. If I had known all this I would have bought a different one. Prices is normal for this type of vacuum.

US,B07R295MLS,R3FBFPKZ9RFBVH,"Good robotic vacuum, but could be better",Style: 11S Max,"Notes and observations:
<br>1. Low profile. Gets under things that a regular vacuum can't get under.
<br>2. Has a remote to control its vacuuming modes.
<br>3. Quiet, compared to a regular vacuum.
<br>4. Relatively inexpensive.
<br>5. Edge vacuum programming works well, but it can't vacuum the area that is 2-3 inches from the wall because the width of the vacuum brushes doesn't span the diameter of the vacuum itself.
<br>6. The vacuuming of any area is totally random, since it uses bump navigation which seems inefficient and there's there's no way to know if the vacuum has actually cleaned the entire area.
<br>7. The vacuum can't vacuum the 2-foot area near the charging base, so that area never gets cleaned.

Would’ve bought the same model, but it is no longer available, so started looking at reviews on newer models. This one seemed to fit the bill, we wanted a simple one to utilize downstairs in our home to help with pet hair and didn’t want a model that mopped. This Eufy seems to struggle with everything. It leaves clumps of dog hair all over the floor, it dies in the middle of the floor before finishing the run despite having been on the charger all day.

I’m very, very happy with Eufy’s customer service and technical support. They really want you to be happy and go the extra mile.

<br>We don’t want the higher tech versions and avoid models with apps and connectivity. We just want it to vacuum, period. We’ve been very happy with the 11s robovacs.

US,B07R295MLS,R2M8G9EHB8PDT3,Greatly exceeded expectations!!,Style: 11S Max,"I am a big fan of the basic Roomba I bought around 10 years ago, but felt that the holiday sales presented a good opportunity to buy another robot vacuum. While doing online research, I was concerned by comments that Roomba product support was not what it used to be, and I also was not interested in spending big bucks on a newer model that took 8 hours to program (my idea of torture!). Reading good reviews of Eufy, I decided to give it a try, and I am very impressed! Here's what I love:
<br>- Simple assembly and replacement of parts.
<br>- Much quieter than my old Roomba.
<br>- Longer battery life than my old Roomba.
<br>- Excellent clean-up -- I would say, better than my old Roomba judging from the amount of cat hair in the receptacle.
<br>- Slimmer design gets under my kitchen cabinets much better than my old Roomba.
<br>- Navigates smoothly between tile, wood and carpets.
<br>- Although the instructions warned to keep the Eufy away from stairs, I watched closely and found that it swept right up to the edge of the stairs without toppling down them, so this is no longer a concern.
<br>I have found only one drawback:
<br>- For some reason, there's an on-off switch on the bottom of the sweeper. Why?? It initially put me into a panic when I couldn't get the sweeper to start!

US,B07R295MLS,R6RP43RLHGTPG,To robot or not to robot...,Style: 11S Max,"Rating four stars even though I'm returning and here's why:
<br>
<br>If you've used a robot vacuum before, this seems like a great low-cost version. It's not super loud (though don't expect it to be silent either) and sucks up everything in its path. It's pretty decent at maneuvering its why around things after a little bumping around. Altogether, perfectly good for the price.
<br>
<br>This is my first time trying out a robot vacuum though, and I was unaware of just how many little things would effect its ability to transverse my apartment. I have a small apartment where the chairs are all too tight for it to get under, ornamental blankets drape off the furniture, a lightweight mirror sits in the corner, dozens of cat toys are spread across the ground, chaotic storage is placed under all the furniture, and small, light carpets sit in five different places, with too-high of pile cat trees in a couple others. In order to make the space usable for the vacuum, I have to spend as much time as I normally would sweeping/vacuuming just to pick up and rearrange things.
<br>
<br>Before purchasing, probably consider whether your space is suitable for a robot vacuum in the first place. If it is, this is great cheaper alternative to the fancier versions. If not, maybe human power is still the best power for you.",是,4,Danny Bryn,2025-02-08
US,B0DCFNZF32,R1AH2RE1T8ES4E,"Easy to clean and maintain, very smart, but not good with pet hair",Style: Omni C20,"I have had the vaccum for a couple of months now so it is time for my review. I have tried a couple of different vaccuum types and brands around the $200-$300 price range. As a working mom of two little boys, I love my robot vacuums! Now that being said my typical favorite is shark, but I love my eufy handheld vacuum so I decided to give this one a shot. Ultimately, Shark comes out on top for me, but there are certain qualities of the eufy that might make it better for you. It ultimately depends on what you are looking for, and in my opinion, if you have a pet. Here is my comparison:
<br>
<br>Ease of maintenance: this is the only reason that makes the race between eufy and shark neck and neck for me. My shark if filled with filters, there are so many different filters hidden in so many different places, it makes it really hard to clean and maintain the vacuum. I don’t even know where all of them are and I have to buy all of these different things. I worry about if they stop making one of these filters, I can’t use the vacuum. And when I empty it, dust and dirt is flies into the air. Where eufy is extremely easy. It has a washable filter that is easy to access. It has a bag which has a closeble tab so when you pull it out all of your dust and dirt is trapped. Everything about this thing is simple, take it off and wash it. Easy as could be.
<br>
<br>Suction/ power: By far my shark as better suction. It doesn’t leave anything behind, enough to pull the dirt out of my wood floor. I have a dog with short hair and it’s enough to constantly clog the eufy. If it’s not clogged on the inside of the vaccuum it’s clogged on the inside of the base. I am stuck manually unclogging it or emptying it, still getting dust and dirt everywhere. This also effects the suction and I have to pay attention constantly to whether it’s clogged or not.
<br>
<br>Smartness: The eufy is by far smarter than my shark. Now you could probably pay more for a smarter shark but price wise, I can set boundaries, map the house, tell it to mop more in the kitchen and only vaccum the living room. I can have it vaccuum the living room more days a week than others. The shark I have just goes back and forth until it hits thing.
<br>
<br>Overall I would love to see how this thing worked if I didn’t have a dog, because I feel like it has enough power to get the job done and it’s ease of maintenance and not having a plethora of different filters to replace is a huge win for me.",是,3,Morgan,2025-02-08

I left “euphy” to due her job in our kitchen I checked on her occasionally and every time I went in she was back to cleaning one particular area (super clean area now btw) and after a fair decent length of time my kitchen floor was still dirty because Euphy was obsessed with 6 square feet. I finally gave up and put her back on her charger and finished the job myself. This occurs in every room I’ve put her to work in. She ignores a third of the floor. I absolutely regret my purchase and wish I spent the extra money on one with a mapping feature.

US,B07R295MLS,R3NLU1PZSCMOHG,Not bad for the price,Style: 11S Max,"A decent non-smart robovacuum that performs as one should expect for a non-smart robovacuum and given what you are paying for it. It will vacuum your floors eventually, doing a decent job, but not as efficiently or thoroughly as smart robovacuums although at a savings of hundreds of dollars. Whether this is the robovacuum for you depends on what you want your robovacuum to do and how much you want to pay for a robovacuum to do that. It works and meets my needs but also has many issues that I am not a fan of but I will deal with those issues while saving $300 to $500.
<br>
<br>Pro – quieter than our previous Roomba. Low profile lets it get under couches and chairs without getting stuck. Decent suction. Handles dust like dirt very well. The included multitool (brush/comb/blade) is very useful and convenient for cleaning out the hair, stings and stands, and thick dust/debris that accumulates in and around the sweeping brush. Decent run time between charges.
<br>
<br>Con – the sleek shiny black surfaces are fingerprint magnets. Straight sweep brush not the width of the vacuum; only 5 1/2 inches wide. Sweep pattern odd. Rather than an incremental direction change allowing for a logical coverage of the floor it redirects to a completely different direction. If confined to one room it would eventually cover the whole room, but if there is a door or passageway to another room it could very easily end up there from one of its redirects. Not the best at sucking up grit dirt. Drops grit when you pick it up as there is a strong tendency for that grit to stay with and around the sweeper brush rather than being sucked into the dirt receptacle. Struggles with going over cords. Documentation is mediocre at best. Some icons on the vacuum and remote do not match those in the documentation.
<br>
<br>**Removing the dust collector filters is totally unintuitive. The filter enclosure has been totally redesigned and appears almost sealed into the dust collector. The filters won’t release with regular poking and prodding and the manual shows an image of it being pulled out from the top with two fingers. (NOT TRUE). To get the filter out you need a flat head screwdriver to pry/torque it out. There is a well with an embossed triangle at the bottom that gives you access to the side of the filter. Insert a large flat head screwdriver in the center and at the top of the exposed filter side. Push in while prying upward and torquing the screwdriver head. This will release the hook tab holding the filter down and the filter will release. When putting the filter back in it is easiest to use the screwdriver to push in to the hooked tab as you slide the filter back down so that tooth more easily clears the dust collector frame.**",是,4,Christopher D.,2025-02-03

US,B0DCFNZF32,R37TG9U4PH5B66,Mid experience for first robovacuum,Style: Omni C20,"Context
<br>- Usage after 2 months.
<br>- This is my first robot vacuum
<br>- Working on 3-5 rooms. Involves hardwood, carpet, and tiles
<br>- Household of long haired people, no pets.
<br>- Bought on sale for $400
<br>
<br>For my first robot vacuum, I’m amazed on the coverage of the little guy. It’s convenient to have the vacuum run while I’m working on other cleaning chores. It gets hard to reach area very nicely.
<br>
<br>But for some annoyances…
<br>Before starting the vacuum, everything needs to be picked off the floors. Yoga mats, socks, clothing, wires to name a few. Otherwise the vacuum will get stuck. There’s no auditory or ping from the app if the robot is stuck. I usually hear the vacuum struggling and I have to fix the problem. So I have to supervise from not too far.
<br>If you have very long hair. The bristles need to be maintained often. I say after 2/3 weekly runs from 3 rooms. But cleaning the bristles isn’t an issue.
<br>The water stations need to be cleaned soon. Couple of days after at the most? Don’t let old/clean water tanks sit for a month, it’ll grow mold.
<br>Running robot on vacuum, then mopping is more effective than running on both modes together. Because of the single brush design, the mop catches the other half the vacuum misses. And then when the robot goes back over the wet surface, it doesn’t pick up everything.
<br>Vacuum performance on plush carpets is mid.
<br>
<br>Overall
<br>I do not trust running the robot if I’m not in the vicinity. As I can only tell if it gets caught from auditory cues, would have been nice if the app alerted in some way. I used this more for its vacuum features. I usually let it pass through the rooms and afterwards I personally mop afterwards. I do not let it vacuum plush carpets.
<br>Personally I do not recommend, I would rather invest in a better robot vacuum and forgo the mop feature.",是,3,Camille Chan,2025-01-28

US,B07R295MLS,REUDI4GSP5SL2,Fits my needs,Style: 11S Max,"I have a huge house with a lot of levels. So I needed something I could plop down in one room and turn on and then empty and put back on the charger. I’ve never had a robot vacuum so I’m not comparing this to anything else. I don’t need it to be on WiFi and I only scheduled it to clean once. What i do is put it in a room before I leave or before bed. It has no problem going from very thin rugs, thick rugs or hard floor. Doesn’t make a big commotion if it bounces into something which it does a good job of not doing. I make sure wires aren’t out and toys are picked up. It collects a ton of dust and lots of small particles. It cleaned up tons of glitter mess from Christmas. The replacement pieces come with a lot of filters and side brushes and a new roller for only $17 bucks. I was able to clean the filter quite easily. It doesn’t need to be replaced until next month and it’s still doing great. Sometimes I just watch it clean haha the remote control is cool too bc I can move it back towards an area I want. It seems to know when it’s in the dinnning room bc it goes around the legs of chairs well. It’s only gotten stuck over one large floor joint once- and usually goes over it quickly. And one time it got stuck under the Christmas tree but that was my fault for not picking up the tree skirt. Bc I have so many levels even on the main floor- I didn’t want something to map out my house and remember any kind of routine. I just wanted something to pin ball around a room and do its best to clean and this thing has exceeded my expectations. I got it for 139 and I’d buy 5 more lol. I love it.",是,5,JeffreyD,2025-01-26

Before buying it for a second time, I read the reviews and product description concerning stairs since this is a change from last time we had it. It claims to have a sensor that detects cliffs and no one with stairs said they had an issue with it falling down them. And yet, Nigel decided to launch himself down our stairs yesterday. He caught some sweet air as he bounced down the stairs until eventually landing at the bottom where he started screaming about his tumble. His wheel popped off on the way down, and he has some scuffs now… but the wheel was easily popped back on. When, he was turned back on, he seemed unbothered and went about his business cleaning as if nothing happened.

I wrote to the company showing them the video where the weight had come undone inside the machine and now it simply would not move off the platform and work. The customer service rep I was assigned took three almost four weeks going back and forth saying I needed to replace the battery and giving incredibly unhelpful advice on how to turn the machine on correctly…ultimately this rep decided I would not get a replacement product because I had thrown away the old machine as it was taking almost 30 days to not even resolve this issue. Yes, apparently you have to return the broken product in order to receive a new one but no where will you know this and they won’t tell you as they string you along well over a month.

US,B07R295MLS,R3BU3CWGCZLAWK,"Reliable, No Frills, Great Cleaning. Lasted 4 Years!",Style: 11S Max,"We purchased our 11S Max almost exactly 4 years ago. During that time, aside from the spinners and rollers and filters, we replaced the battery, one wheel, the gears for one brush, and one other thing that required full disassembly and reassembly that wasn't terrible to replace. Over time, the button on top started turning red when fully charged but we never figured out why, even after replacing the battery (it was only lasting 30 minutes when we replaced it about 3 years in) and it stopped responding to ""scheduling"" (though we were able to get around that by running it until the battery ran out completely and then leaving it sitting off the charger overnight and later recharging it and it would ""schedule"" to whenever it finished that recharge. After 4 years, I think it may be time to finally replace it because the roller brush has apparently worn the insertion point round/smooth where it should be square and we can no longer replace the roller brush and it's not picking anything up lately. It has held up on floor rugs, carpets and hardwoods with three dogs and three people in the house. It has repeatedly picked up and filled its bin after vacuuming with a normal vacuum cleaner. Sure, it gets stuck under our couches and the freezer occasionally, but it's a minor inconvenience. Here lately it's attempted to make a run for it out the front or back door and once misjudged where the stairs were, so I guess that sensor is probably giving out too. It's (relatively) quiet, easy to empty, industrious and kinda fun to watch bump around,. We've been thrilled with its performance and ease of use and reliability this entire time! Our ONLY gripe has been that it's a pain to clear off the roller brush.
<br>
<br>For how easy this has been to maintain and how much it's helped regarding keeping the fur and dust bunnies in check, this has been worth every penny and we'll happily get another one, maybe even one for upstairs and downstairs this time.",是,5,Megan,2025-01-18

The 2nd was iRobot, it was horrible, but I got it as an open box pretty cheap. This one is definitely not as good as the Vrillo, but is slightly better than the iRobot. Here's a few of the issues: 1. Very random pattern that ends up covering the same area multiple times while completely missing others. 2. Vacuum climbs over everything including thick, plush carpet with a towel laid on top of it (That is in place to keep our dog from getting mud on the floor when coming through the doggy door.), but then manages to get stuck on the same towel but on the opposite end of it. 3. Vacuum gets stuck under chairs, cabinets, etc. It tries to go under things that it literally can't fit under. It's like it squats down to try to squeeze in, then just starts beeping. 4. No app control, remote control only with direct line of sight. (Positive side of that, no WiFi reporting home of your home contents).
<br>
<br>The good: It is quiet, and seems to clean fairly well where it actually does go. So far it keeps to the schedule we've set for it. No issues with it getting stuck at the top of stairs, it backs up and goes elsewhere without falling off the edge.
<br>
<br>We've had to start keeping doors closed anywhere we don't want it to go.

<br>Unfortunately, when we opened the box, a part was missing. I returned that unit and have been waiting for a refund. It states that refunds take 7-8 days and it has only been 6 days. In the meantime, I decided to order a replacement RoboVac.
<br>
<br>My son, who works in IT, tried to set up the replacement yesterday, but it will not connect to the internet despite his best efforts. I’m confident in his expertise, so this appears to be an issue with the device itself.
<br>
<br>At this point, I am not going to send this one back because both my son and I are already out the money and cannot justify ordering a third unit. Although I am sure I will the refund soon I cannot pay for another one while waiting for the refund.

<br>
<br>Bought this back in 2020 and it runs better than the Roomba I got in 2023. I have 3 shiba inus, so they shed every day and this baby is able to pick up the larger chucks before I vacuum over it. I've only needed to change the main battery it comes with, once in 5 years, and the bristles every now and then but they're cheaper than the Roomba replacement parts. The sensors are way better at detecting objects/walls/ledges, it runs quieter and the wheels are pretty good at getting over floor transitions/low floor edges. I've never had issues with the docking charger.

Eufy support doesn’t exist. They don’t offer any help. I contacted them regarding the vacuum that completely died and they only offered me a 10% discount for a future purchase. It is a joke how they expect customers to accept a one year lifetime. But they do. From now on, I will buy the cheapest robovacuums cause they all last 1 year.

I did vacuum before initial use and have vacuumed while having this.

Checked bag mostly full. Changed it out. Time will tell.
<br>I do like this vacuum so far. Does a good good mopping and vacuuming. The software seems easy enough to use. You can customize a lot of it's features.

<br>
<br>I don’t have a big apartment but for a 1000 sqf space, it has to go back to station to clean itself up twice. Since I bought it a month ago, two out of three runs it couldn’t finish because of various issues, eg something got stuck, cable trouble or lost in the room.

US,B07R295MLS,R2OQXBB6GLB6XK,"Great vacuum, works surprisingly well",,"So, I got my Eufy yesterday and have now used it for two one hour+ cleaning sessions. There are a few things you need to do for best performance:
<br>
<br>As noted in the instructions, tie up any small wires- they will get tied up in the wheels of the RoboVac.
<br>
<br>Watch it as it goes about its work, you will find a few dead ends where it gets caught. Block those off temporarily with a book or similar.
<br>
<br>Until I blocked it off with a couple of brooms laid down, the Eufy spent almost half of its time in the dining room. All of those chair and table legs created lots of dead ends, nooks and crannies for it to explore. It never got stuck, but did waste a lot of time until I blocked it.
<br>
<br>We have about 1,000 sq ft accessible by the Eufy and after two hours I think it was about 50-75% clean. It would take another 2-3 hours to get it to 90+%. I will probably run it once each day and that will probably keep us pretty clean.
<br>
<br>It easily got over a transition from LVF to low pile carpet and didn’t clean as deep as a vacuum, but it did pretty good.
<br>
<br>When it gets low on juice, it shuts down the vacuum and heads to its charging cradle. It was amazing to watch that happen. When it docks it then goes into recharge mode for the next time.
<br>
<br>So, the foregoing is the good. Here is the bad and ugly:
<br>
<br>I have a dog that sheds. After one or two sessions, it is a PITA to clean out all of that hair. The roller is completely stuffed with hair. You have to cut it out piece by piece with a short, sharp paring knife. Especially difficult was the small wheel in the front. The wheel pops out, but then you have to dig, piece by little piece of hair stuck in the bearings. Eufy needs to design a wheel that disassembles for cleaning.
<br>
<br>The large dirt/hair tray did pull out and opened for easy dumping.
<br>
<br>So, it works, it picks up dirt and pet hair, but it is a PITA to clean. I think I can do a complete sweep up of my living area in the time it takes to remove all that hair.
<br>
<br>If you have a pet that sheds, be aware.",是,5,David,2025-01-03

Area rugs were ok but I kept it out of a carpeted bedroom. After a few weeks of use, we are relocating it to the master bedroom and limiting the area that it needs to clean. It can’t handle the whole house. I’ve ordered another Shark, I think that is a better robot vacuum, and it does a better job of avoiding objects (doesn’t get stuck).

<br>
<br>I used it a bit earlier in the day and if the brush roll gets clogged with hair, it beeps a few times and dies. Once you clear the brush roll out it can go back to cleaning. Since this is the first time we are using it and I shed like a husky, I'm gonna need to clear it out a few times I imagine.
<br>
<br>Anyway, the last time it died on me, I wasn't able to find it fast enough. We know generally where the beeping came from. But to our amazement? We can't find it anywhere. We have searched everywhere it could possibly be and it just does not seem to exist.
<br>
<br>We've given up our search and rescue efforts tonight. Wish us luck that we find it soon. My current conspiracy theory is that Amazon trained it to come back.
<br>
<br>I will say, I was extremely impressed with how much it picked up in the short time we'd used it. I did learn that you have to hold it over a trash can when you empty it because a lot of dirt does fall out when opened. The amount of dust bunnies it grabbed was impressive and it even sucked up a small metal tool that had dropped on the floor.

If you are proactive and willing to empty the vacuum after each use then great!... but the whole point of a robot vac is so I have less work to do which is negated if I have to empty a vac after each use.

<br>For the past 15 years we've been using two Roomba 535 robot vacuums. They are effective, but lack smart navigation. Their random travel paths tend to bump into everything and leave wear marks on floorboards and furniture.
<br>
<br>So a couple months ago I started searching for a new robot vacuum that had a mopping feature. After watching many YouTube review videos, I narrowed down my choice to the highly rated Eufy X10 Pro. It checks-off all the boxes except one: It was too tall to go under our furniture. So I decided to wait for something shorter to come along.
<br>
<br>Fast forward to Nov 2024. I noticed the recently released Eufy Omni C20 during Amazon's Black Friday event. The C20 was on sale for only $400, which seemed like a bargain. Although it lacks some features of Eufy's flagship X10 Pro, it is small enough to go under our furniture. Online reviews were very positive too.
<br>
<br>And I'm happy to report that the C20 is doing a great job at vacuuming and mopping. Navigation is fantastic; It efficiently follows the mapped rooms of our home without banging into everything.
<br>
<br>There's about 1100 Sq ft of actual floor area to clean. Half is carpet and the other half is LVP (hard surface). It takes all day to clean everything due to the periodic return-to-home recharge cycles and repeat visits to clean the mop. So I've created Scenarios that are area specific to allow us to narrow down what area to clean, which shortens the intrusion times.
<br>
<br>The Android Smartphone App is functional, but needs improvement. For example:
<br>
<br>1. Room labels are too small and often placed on top of border lines which makes them difficult to read.
<br>
<br>2. Our kitchen and living room were initially mapped as one room. So I used the app's map edit function and divided the space into two rooms. A couple days after doing that I needed to edit my division line, but there's no feature that does this. So I had to merged the two rooms back together, then performed the divide function again.
<br>
<br>That cause a major headache; This new edit broke all the ""Scenarios"" actions I had created. When I tried to fix them, only the old map was shown, not the new one with the updated division placement.
<br>
<br>After a couple hours of hair pulling, I discovered I could enable the app to use the multi-map feature, wait two minutes, then disable multi-map. After doing that, the revised map appeared in the Scenarios function.
<br>
<br>3. We're Alexa users and fortunately the C20 supports voice control. But only to clean the entire house. We would like to use Alexa to tell the C20 to clean a specific room and/or trigger a user defined Scenarios action. Eufy please add this ability to the Alexa feature!
<br>
<br>Final Remarks:
<br>The Omni C20 works surprisingly well. It is a good value, especially if you buy it during an Amazon sale event. This would have been a 5-star review if the Android Smartphone App was better.",否,4,ThomasBlue 🐕,2024-12-30

US,B0DCFNZF32,R24UR03WTISMHM,Way better than your old robot!,,"Purchased based on “just a dad” videos on YouTube. Debated on the eufy 10? ( the one with the better mapping and obstacle detection ) But decided to take a chance on the Omni 20. Review coming from a cluttered house with 3 kids under 8 this thing has done better than expected.. it doesn’t push items around for example we have our Christmas tree up and it goes around it great doesn’t wad the tree skirt up at all. Old house so we have a large cold air register it does struggle with it but the app allowed me to block it and the unit simply goes around it which allows it to reach the rest of the house. Obviously I try to pick most things up before it runs socks etc and cords. (Did wrap up a cell phone cord one time) but it was able to return home and charge itself so that was a plus!
<br>I was able to pull the couch out from the wall and using the map feature direct it to clean behind, it worked! Coming from a robot vacuums from 4 years ago this thing is great! The mopping feature seems fine to me,no it doesn’t have a on board water tank and I’ve set it to return home every 5 minutes which likely leads to it using more water but I’ll gladly take it.. haven’t had to empty the dust bag or change mopping pads yet , it did not come with mopping solution, bought the “shark” mopping solution at Walmart and it works fine. My floors are 90% hard wood with a rug under the dining room table it does ok on the rug but it will do much better if I pull the chairs out and allow it its space . I also don’t expect it to clean the bathroom too small to many rugs and such.
<br>The battery seems to sufficiently enough to clean 1000 sq feet on mop and vacuum.. but either way the thing finds it home base unlike the previous units I’ve had very happy for the Black Friday price of $400",是,5,P. Harris,2024-12-14

Almost no setup time and is up and running, voila!!!. Can be used manually to guide in specific areas without wasting time and or you can let it do what it does without human interactions and can be scheduled through the remote control. No fancy interface, just setup the clock on remote, and schedule the clean up, done!",是,5,Carlos Irizarry,2024-12-14

US,B07R295MLS,RGX5DQ0BJXZEK,5 Yrs and still running!! Love this vacuum!!!,,"I bought this vacuum just over 5 yrs ago. Seriously, 5 yrs!!! This is one of my best buys EVER and I STILL love it!! It also still works great!! I recently looked up how long robot vacuums typically last and it appears 3 yrs is pretty average. So I have definitely gotten my money's worth. This vacuum has aged... it is reasonably loud these days (it was quiet for a long time though) and one of the side spinning brushes is wonky... which I think mostly causes the noise. That being said, the suction is still great. It's still reliable. It still lasts the advertised 100 minutes or so. Honestly that's pretty impressive. I have had to change the battery once which I think is even better than projected for the battery life. So no complaints there. I got about 2.5/3 yrs on the original battery and I'm still going on the second one. Beyond my amazement at how long this vacuum has lasted and how well it has aged... this model cleans great, is super easy to use, is durable and doesn't get caught on anything once you have vacuum proofed things. I have cords tied up off the ground, I pick up pet toys and anything that shouldn't be lying around anyway if I was going to be vacuuming with my upright. This model is very slim and gets under my couches, coffee table, entertainment cabinets, bird cages, etc. No build up of dust under these items which is really nice. It works well on the area rugs we have, the hardwood, tile and carpeting. And if you have pets it's a must have!!! We have a long haired dog, cat and three birds and this vacuum makes my life so much easier!! I really can't recommend it enough. This model doesn't have the fancy mapping, WIFI capabilities or the app but honestly I don't need that stuff. It has a remote, I'm good with that. I am actually buying a second one because it's $40 cheaper right now than the deal I got 5 yrs ago (which was a good deal I thought) and I don't want to chance my current one does bite the dust (😁 sorry, just seemed applicable here). I would hate to have to pay full price for a new one. Maybe I'll retire my noisy one that has definitely outlived it's typical life expectancy or maybe I will just move it down to our carpeted basement. I HIGHLY recommend this brand and model. It has absolutely exceeded my expectations!!",是,5,Amazon Customer,2024-12-13

US,B0DCFNZF32,R1ETTD9L6OW4E,"This might sound dramatic, but",,"This product has actually been life changing for me. I have a large area (around 900sq ft), 2 giant dogs, 3 cats, and 1 child. I started with shark mop/vacuum combos in my smaller rooms. And I was satisfied with their performance enough to buy this Eufy. I could not be happier with the work this thing has taken off my plate. It was just not feasible to mop everyday, despite my floors needing it. Now my floors get cleaned (SO WELL) EVERY SINGLE DAY. The eufy does NOT disappoint. You have a ton of customization options in the app (which is amazing-and monitors performance life of different components making maintenance a breeze). I love the clear tanks to keep an eye on water levels. And the dirty water I pour out of this thing....it's shocking. I am someone who tends to feel more anxious when my house is messy. So, not to be dramatic, but my quality of life in my house since buying this has gone up a lottt. Such little effort on my part for such an amazing result. I will be upgrading my sharks to this Eufy model as time goes on, due to the convenience of the Eufy self emptying, the self wash and dry pads, and the app.

This seemed okay at first, though unlike my shark and roomie models it seemed to get jammed under furniture and caught on tassles and thus required a lot of changing of the house to make it work. It also left piles of debris all around the base. Still, for under $150 I thought it was okay if endlessly frustrating. I'd gone on vacation after buying it, so I couldn't return it....

It has everything I am looking for: mopping, automatic dust collection, an easy-to-use app, etc. I have to say the mopping function is excellent and it can automatically change to vacuum mode when it moves onto carpets.

To its credit, even though some pieces popped off, I was able to put it back together and it still runs.

<br>
<br>This is bare bones robot vacuum. I had to ""supervise"" it but it has definitely made my life easier. My housemates own a cat and they done clean up much. They leave crumbs. Think post college young adults. They're not slobs but I'm the main one cleaning, sanitizing. For example, they don't clean their cat water fountain. Like periodically a person has to do that or buildup will occur.
<br>
<br>This unit is good for one house cat, living with adult humans. No kids.
<br>
<br>This unit will NOT be able to handle excessive shedding from a large dog or multiple cats. It'd fill up the dirt catch too soon.
<br>
<br>It also is like a base model imo. Idk if that's true. But that's to say, this is solely a vacuum model. I didn't buy the mop /dual due to affordability but also, this household needs old school mopping.
<br>
<br>I doubt barring like the top price model could handle the amount of dirt my housemates walk in with.
<br>
<br>Pro/con this unit being affordable on sale helps me
<br>
<br>1. Upkeep when I deep clean because I'm the only ""adult"" actually cleaning regular and up to standards outside a college graduate stereotype.
<br>2. It needs monitoring because it isn't super smart but within my budget (the title about temper expectations) it is helpful 5/5
<br>3. I have no idea how long this unit will last. In a way being affordable I could see this unit eventually dying it's not built to last 5 years based on build quality. I'm guessing 3 years tops? But mileage will vary. This is to say consider if your needs and this budget is worth it. Maybe another model is more durable?
<br>
<br>Overall I'm happy I took a chance and got this fella. Pictured is the first ""sweep"" the unit took. Surprised it fit under our couch. It kind of got lost under there for a while. Clear it does the job. Picked up dried cat kibble and some kitty litter. See image. It also docked proper, but
<br>
<br>Cons. Despite hitting the charge go to base on remote the unit needed me to press it like 3 times. Idk.
<br>
<br>I can see this as a a good gift for a single person graduate from college who doesn't vacuum. Or someone like me who needs upkeep help.

US,B07R295MLS,R2BPKVMO73KR2J,Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX: A Dependable Cleaning Companion!,Style: 11S Max,"Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX Review
<br>
<br>The Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX has truly impressed me with its sleek, compact design. Its super-thin profile of just 2.85 inches allows it to easily glide under furniture, and the black finish fits perfectly with my home decor. The build quality feels solid and durable, balancing lightweight design with sturdiness.
<br>
<br>Performance
<br>
<br>Suction Power: The powerful suction capability of 1300Pa is a standout feature. It effectively picks up dirt, dust, and pet hair from both hard floors and medium-pile carpets. The BoostIQ technology is especially helpful, automatically increasing suction when transitioning onto carpets for a more thorough clean.
<br>
<br>Cleaning Efficiency: I’ve found that the 11S MAX navigates spaces efficiently, using systematic cleaning patterns. It transitions smoothly between different floor types and has sensors that help it avoid obstacles and prevent falls.
<br>
<br>Noise Level
<br>
<br>One aspect I appreciate is how quiet it operates. Compared to other vacuums I've used, the 11S MAX runs at a significantly lower noise level, which makes it perfect for daytime cleaning without disturbing anyone in the house.
<br>
<br>Battery Life and Charging
<br>
<br>With a battery life of around 100 minutes, this vacuum covers my medium-sized home comfortably on a single charge. When the battery runs low, it automatically returns to the charging dock, which is incredibly convenient.
<br>
<br>App Connectivity and Features
<br>
<br>While it doesn’t offer advanced app features found in more premium models, the remote control is straightforward and user-friendly. It allows for manual operation and scheduling, although I do wish it had Wi-Fi connectivity for smart home integration.
<br>
<br>Maintenance and Cleaning
<br>
<br>Maintaining the 11S MAX has been relatively hassle-free. The dustbin is easy to remove and clean, and the washable filters help save on costs. The brushes do collect hair and debris, but they detach easily for cleaning.
<br>
<br>What I Like
<br>
<br>1. Powerful Suction: The vacuum effectively picks up dirt and pet hair from various surfaces.
<br>2. Quiet Operation: It runs quietly, allowing for use during the day without disruption.
<br>3. Compact Design: Its slim profile makes it easy to clean tight spaces.
<br>4. Automatic Charging: It returns to the dock when the battery is low, ensuring it’s always ready for use.
<br>5. Ease of Maintenance: Simple dustbin and brush cleaning processes make upkeep easy.
<br>
<br>What I Don’t Like
<br>
<br>1. Limited Smart Features: It lacks Wi-Fi connectivity and advanced app features for remote control and scheduling.
<br>2. Obstacle Navigation: Occasionally, it gets stuck on high thresholds or low furniture, though this doesn't happen frequently.
<br>3. Dustbin Capacity: The dustbin is on the smaller side, requiring more frequent emptying, especially with pets around.
<br>
<br>Overall Experience
<br>
<br>Overall, the Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX has provided a reliable cleaning solution for my home. Its impressive suction power and quiet operation make it a great addition to my cleaning routine.

This apparently satisfied the machine and it ran fine again. Doesn't clean as well, but it still works.
<br>Now, after two years of working (mostly) flawlessly on my upstairs floor, this thing decides to throw itself down the stairs. Odd, but probably a fluke. It then throws itself down my stairs 6 more times over the course of its cleaning cycle. Now it can't go more than 5 minutes without throwing itself down the stairs.

I am very impressed with several features of the C20: 1) The mapping feature is great. It drives around a bit and scans the area fairly quickly to create its map. 2) It cleans in a methodical fashion - first it covers the perimeter then in cleans back and forth in overlapping passes until it finishes an area. 3) It manages to unstick itself pretty well. It got tangled in the edge of a beach towel we have under a metal dog crate and completed several acrobatic moves to extract itself. 4) I’m still messing with the app, but it allows you to edit the map and divide areas into separate rooms. 5) Connecting it to Alexa was seamless. 6) It reacts quickly when it senses carpet or a throw rug to stop mopping and switch to vacuum only. There a few areas where in can be improved. The mopping function is great, but does not clean as well as hand mopping. I will try purchasing some of the cleaning solution to see if that will improve. Sometimes it will randomly miss a small section. It will pick up the area next time it runs however. So far, I’m very happy. It works its way around furniture and is very persistent about getting in tight places. Another plus is that it is much cheaper than some of the name brand vacs with similar features!

US,B07R295MLS,R17CT6J5LR5WIU,Perfect for a perfectly square room and that’s about it,Style: 11S Max,"My house is very simple. Lots of straight lines and not a lot of furniture, I’m quite a minimalist. Which is why I thought any robot vacuum would work. But I was wrong.
<br>
<br>Pros: vacuums around round things very well, and the suction works nicely - it really does pick up stuff well and gets all the dust from my bird off my LVP
<br>
<br>Cons: it doesn’t map, which I don’t really understand how you can have a robot vacuum that doesn’t map because it will NEVER understand where it has been and where it hasn’t. This vacuum, after running on auto for about 20 minutes, vacuumed the same two spots in my house repeatedly, missing a lot of spots. When it hits a wall, it either determines that the wall will keep going (and just vacuums along the wall, going a completely different direction when the wall ends) or it turns around 180 degrees and goes the other direction but diagonally so it literally misses everything and just follows the same path it was just on. It hates rugs, so despite the advertising saying it could go from hard wood to a low pile rug, that was incorrect. It got caught up on two of my rugs and the brush fell off. For some reason, it got stuck in my foyer just going back and forth repeatedly about 10 times before it finally left that room, only to return back to it after a spin in my kitchen (where it missed 90% of the floor?) and ended up getting stuck in that same spot in my foyer. Why did it go back to my foyer when it already vacuumed there? No mapping, that’s why.
<br>
<br>I don’t really understand owning a robot vacuum that you have to keep an eye on. The reason you own one is so you can move on with your other chores or life responsibilities. You might as well just pick up your own vacuum and do your own floor if you’re just gonna have to follow this robot around everywhere.",是,3,Nonna Beeswax,2024-10-21

This Eufy was half the price of the cheapest Roomba and it was pretty well reviewed so I thought I'd give it a shot. It arrived packaged very well, documents were ok, set up was easy. Here's what I found. It's quiet so I can be in the same room when it's doing its' job. It's slim so it gets under things the Roomba doesn't. It's great on hard floors, ok on carpet but not as good as the Roomba on deep pile. It gets stuck where my Roomba gets stuck under the sofa but additionally has an issue with the base of my tower fan when the Roomba doesn't. It isn't connected to Wifi but that doesn't bother me. I have too many smart devices anyway and the Eufy has a remote that works well. So far the coolest thing is that when you order it home, it stops vacuuming and silently (well almost) speeds up looking for its' kennel. Oh yes it takes quite a while to charge. At least a couple of hours. But that charge lasts way longer than my Roomba - in fact it lasts for ages (I tried to time exactly how long but it was so long I got bored waiting for it to finish).

<br>
<br>Setup was incredibly easy, and my kids had SO much fun watching it map the house and watching the app as it filled in the floor map. It was a nice lesson showing them the cameras and how it has the front bumper, spinner and cameras to guide it.
<br>
<br>Now that its set up it just goes around the house cleaning the floors as scheduled. It only has one piece to replace and that is the bags in the base station as it purges its tank.
<br>
<br>This does a good job on hard floors and laid carpet, but it can get caught up on rugs but only my cheap lightweight ones. I only have those in one room and since its a guest room I just blocked that room off in the app.
<br>
<br>scheduling software is also easy. Just go in and tell it when to do the floors. I chose times I will be home as I want to make sure its not mopping the carpet or something but so far its only done the hard floors so maybe I will change that in the future as I trust it more.
<br>
<br>The vacuum is very quiet and I barely notice it as it goes in the background. The mopping is a little louder but likewise it is easy to drown out. The vacuum struggles with larger items like leaves, but for dirt/crumbs it does a good job.

US,B07R295MLS,R2RCZBIHTXXCZ0,The 11S max is a wonderful vacuum! The L60 SES is exceptional.,Style: 11S Max,"11S Max- Pros: I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy, power, and slim fit (goes under my dusty dresser, nightstands, and bed). Picks up hair and dust and bits of stuff well! It vacuums for a good lonbb go time so every to Ingush sparkling clean, and the remote control has just enough functionality not to be confusing or over the top. I have another Eufy vac (L60 SES) and although this doesn’t have as many features, I can honestly say it is WELL worth the money. It has saved me so much time just in the last few days. I like the timer feature so it cleans the same time each day and I’m sure things stay tidy.
<br>
<br>Cons: I can’t think of too many honestly. I just use it for our large bedroom and master bathroom. If it were for the whole house I’d get a mapping model. You do have to empty the dirt tray each time, and I have to cut off the hair from the brushes with the included hair remover. Again, for a large area I’d get the other model which has the hair cutter and automatic emptier. Too much time to take hair off all the time for a large area. But for my large bedroom and bath it’s money well spent!
<br>
<br>L60SES pros: it cleans very very well. I love the hair cutting and automatic emptying feature. The mapping feature works really well, and the vacuum follows the schedules well. I have been very pleased with this purchase and it is saving me tons of time. I have three shedding cats and the hair was driving me crazy. I like that it empties into a station and I just have to change out the bag. It has other nice features like quiet mode. I absolutely would recommend this and the 11S (see other review) ; they serve different purposes depending on needs.
<br>
<br>L60SES cons: none really, except that it does get caught occasionally trying to get under furniture, but it turns off if it stalls too long so it doesn’t drain the battery.

US,B07R295MLS,R3H76YDPWWVPYC,11S isn't what it used to be,Style: 11S Max,"I had an older version of the 11S that worked for YEARS. Always kept the floors so clean, and I have tile, wool rugs (wool sheds a lot), girls with long hair, and wood floors (approx 2000 sq ft). It was an amazing unit. I also bought an L70 unit just for mopping, maybe 2 years ago.
<br>
<br>When my husband decided to service the older 11S unit, he did something and it is now dead. So, I bought this new version.
<br>
<br>The new version only has 1 brush at the front, and in my experience, means it picks up far less. The L70 has only one rotating brush, and could never keep up with the older 11S in terms of dirt pickup. It is crazy loud, and this is coming from someone who has had a iRobot, and 2 prior eufy's. Additionally, after initiating its maiden run, it almost immediately got stuck on a dining room chair's legs and couldn't get unstuck. There is no map with this unit, whereas the L70 has a map, and I do think there is value for a map, but not at the expense of inferior pickup, which is why I opted to replace the older 11S.

US,B0DCFNZF32,R39WP3WYX6QKMD,"Easy setup, Fascinating.",,"I have resisted the idea of an automated vacuum cleaner for a long time, thinking that they were just expensive toys.
<br>
<br>However the opportunity to test this was offered to me as an Amazon Vine reviewer and I have had the chance to see how this works. It's fascinating.
<br>
<br>This model has a fairly competent vacuum and the ability to mop the appropriate floors with water. It basically can be taught to know where to mop and where to vacuum and it does so with ease. As with any autonomous device, you need to make sure that the areas you want cleaned are not confusing to the algo--meaning, don't leave too much stuff around for it to have to figure out and make sure there is nothing which will trap it. It wasn't much of an issue in practice and any hiccups are easily remedied.
<br>
<br>There is no remote control--just an app. I found set up to be pretty straightforward--you are asked to charge the unit thoroughly before proceeding. So when you receive this, you might want to go ahead and charge it right away.
<br>
<br>The mopping part was really interesting as well. The device is able to mop, store the dirty water, discharge it into its home base and take on clean water by itself. It also air dries and cleans its own mop.
<br>
<br>For me, this is an ideal compromise since you can have this clean the floors every day. It is thorough enough to mostly eliminate typical spills and spots that a tile floor will accumulate during the day saving you to do a more through hand mopping only when the floor really needs it.
<br>
<br>Vacuuming is also pretty competent, covering most areas and retrieving a fair amount of stuff that you might not even notice. It won't eliminate entirely the need for a hand vacuuming from time to time but it is surprisingly good at what it is supposed to do. The Eufy is round and room corners are usually square so that is one inherent issue since the machine cannot really get into the entire corner due to its shape but I judge it not to be too important.
<br>
<br>The build quality is very good--this is a rugged device that should last if taken care of.
<br>
<br>Overall, I am impressed with this--much more than I expected to be.",否,4,LKF,2024-10-07

US,B0DCFNZF32,R33PA33MAK2BC6,Eufy needs to improve the sensors and a few more things,,"The media could not be loaded.     This is my third Eufy robot vacuum and my fourth robot vacuum overall. I previously loved my first Eufy 30C from 2019, then upgraded to the Eufy G10 Hybrid in 2022. In 2024, I tried the Dreame L10s Pro Gen 2, which became my favorite despite lacking auto-emptying and mop washing/drying features. So, I decided to try the Eufy Omni C20 All-in-One Station.
<br>
<br>The Eufy Omni C20 was easy to set up. The box included a quick start guide and safety information but no detailed instruction manual. I found the user manual in the app after adding the device to my phone. The robot mapped my home in about 20 minutes and did a decent job. However, the first cleaning was not impressive compared to my Dreame L10s. The Eufy got stuck on a floor carpet, ran over my shoes (I know it says to pick up objects, but my Dreame never ran over my shoes), and then got stuck under a side table (see picture). My Dreame vac had no issues navigating around this same side table.
<br>
<br>The Eufy Omni C20’s auto-empty feature, mop head cleaning, and drying were impressive (though quite noisy—see video). Unfortunately, I was not impressed with its object sensing. The vacuum seemed clumsy, often bumping into furniture and getting stuck. While the auto-empty and mop cleaning station is a nice upgrade, the navigation and obstacle sensing need improvement. Overall, a decent robot vacuum, but it fell short of my expectations based on previous experiences with Eufy and my current Dreame L10s.",否,3,Rebecca,2024-10-06

It mapped the house really well, and quickly figured out where to vacuum and where to mop (or not mop - like our area rugs). The main level of our house is mostly tile (except for 1 bedroom and the previousely mentioned area rugs, so having a vacuum and mop is a game changer. It does a nice job vacuuming even along the edges. Corners aren't great, but that's pretty minimal. So far, it hasn't gotten stuck on anything. We try really hard to make sure there are no obstacles left out when the robot is scheduled to do its thing seeing as it tried to eat a computer cable. The cable was no worse for the wear, but we realized pretty quickly that we need to make sure things are picked up and out of its way. I guess it is helping us keep the house clean in multiple ways LOL! I am incredibly impressed with a few of the features. The first is the robot's ability to figure out where it is if it gets interupted/moved. We have had similar robots in the past, but if they got moved they would just stop until we took it back to its docking station. The biggest issue was it would start over as opposed to going back to where it left off. This one seems to be able to figure out where it is, and completes the cleaning cycle where it left off. It also monitors how much batter life it has. If it doesn't have enough power left to finish the job, it goes back to it's charging station, empties, cleans itself, goes through the drying cycle, recharges, and then picks up where it left off. It's amazing! The mopping function is incredible too. Other robot mops have one large stationary mop head (some vibrate, but that's pretty much it). This one has two small rotating mop heads. In my humble opinion, this is a far superior way of mopping, and there is a noticable difference. I love the way this machine cleans, and even dries itself.

The filter on the 11S MAX gets clogged EVERY time you use it and it takes a while to clean it.

I am so disappointed I didn't realize this in time to return it. If you look at the 11S it has a screen over the filter to keep dirt from clogging the filter and a foam pad behind the filter to provide further filtration. This is the filtration system I had on previous robo vacs that worked so well. You would think the ""Max"" would provide something more than the 11S but its definitely inferior.

It splits areas into rooms, and I did have to manually mark a couple of room boundaries. You can pick a specific room to clean, or let it go to owrk.
<br>The cleaning action is great - you can pick mop and vacuum or each individually. The vacuum can sense carpet and stops the mop feature when going over carpet, then picks right back up with mopping when getting off of carpet or a rug.
<br>It cleans the mops when it returns and puts the dirty water in the dirty water canister. It then air drys the mops! It also sucks the dirt into a disposable bag, inside of the machine.

<br>This machine includes no remote control -- which I was hoping to get -- but instead only works with a phone app. I'm not a fan of apps at all, especially when you have to depend on connectivity when you need to use an appliance or tool that should work even without a connection.
<br>
<br>You also must have the internet to read the manual to figure out how to use it. There's a ""startup"" guide included on a piece of cardboard, but that's just for setup, not usage. I would prefer even a short usage manual to read through before I have to log in to use it. I'd love it more if it used a remote rather than my unreliable cell phone &amp; WiFi!
<br>
<br>Second, while it's great with notifications and locating the unit, it's not very comprehensive. For example, when I used the vac the first time (after it ""mapped"" my house), it started lagging a lot and not working too well. After an hour of investigating and not seeing any alerts or instructions, I accidentally found out I had to empty the vac's bin. This was nowhere in the setup or usage instructions, and no alerts at all that it was full.
<br>
<br>It's still new, and I may run into more unforeseen issues (which I'll update here if I do), but beyond that we're pretty happy with this thing. We haven't used the mop feature, only the vac, so I can't speak to that part. It took 41 minutes to vacuum 3 rooms before it got down to 23% battery and docked itself to recharge, and it did a good job even in corners and crevices. It took about 6 hours to recharge to 100%.
<br>
<br>I do recommend that you read all the instructions &amp; reviews that you can for tips &amp; precautions. This will suck up things you don't want it to, so be sure you clear the floors of cables &amp; stringy things, including rug or blanket fringes, before setting the vac loose. And don't forget to check the dustbin in the vac often, now that you know about it. :)
<br>
<br>I'm giving this 4 stars because it does a much better job than I expected, despite the issues I mentioned above. It's quieter than my push vac, and my cats quickly went from being terrified of it to very curious about it and no longer afraid. We're already so fond of this vac, we're talking about sticking some googly eyes on it and naming it! lol
<br>
<br>If you have any questions, ask away, and if your question reaches me I'll do my best to answer what I know. I'll definitely be back here to update if anything notable happens with it as I continue to use it.",否,4,"""DO ALL THE THINGS"" Brooks",2024-09-29

US,B07R295MLS,R3K6N8JY0QFWML,Randomly drove around the house,Style: 11S Max,"This was my first attempt at a robot vacuum. I bought it mostly because of the price. It was on sale and figured that it might be worth it. There's no real way to program it, other than a few remote buttons. It drove around randomly and as soon as it touched something it went in opposite direction then back again. No lines and it missed a considerable amount of carpet. It missed half of my living room then went to bedroom to do the same. I don't have time to watch it and use the remote to drive it like a toy car... defeated the purpose of a robot. I ended up returning it and will get an app smart based one instead. This one didn't really have any kind of smarts.",是,2,Sensue,2024-09-29

Before it runs, I have to clean up, move the gaming chair, close the closet, and tuck up the curtains.

US,B0DCFNZF32,R2YBR6KFVL9W7L,"Amazing Time Saver for Busy Parents, Worth Every Penny!",Style: C20,"As a busy mom cleaning a four-bedroom house, this Eufy robot cleaner has been a game-changer for my cleaning routine. My toddler leaves crumbs everywhere, and I shed hair constantly. This robot’s powerful 7,000 Pa suction picks up all the crumbs and hair reliably, leaving my floors spotless. Its auto-emptying and mop-washing features make the process effortless, freeing up time for more important things.
<br>
<br>One of my favorite aspects is its ultra-slim design (just 3.35 inches), which allows it to clean under most furniture. Although it struggles with lower spaces like under my coffee table, it still gets into many hard-to-reach areas, especially under beds and desks, where manual cleaning used to be a pain.
<br>
<br>The mop function is fantastic—it scrubs my floors better than I ever did by hand. I also love the hands-free system, which automatically dries the mop, so I don’t have to deal with damp clothes or musty smells.
<br>The price might seem steep, but considering the time saved from vacuuming and mopping daily, it’s a great value. Plus, the Pro-Detangle comb eliminates the hassle of manually cleaning tangled hair from the brush!

It loves being thorough under my couch, under other pieces of furniture, and other places you can’t see. My floors are cleaner and I didn’t have to do it myself, which is nice, but if I knew it was gonna meander about loudly and miss a thousand spots in the most open parts of the floor and spend most of its time under my couch, I would have picked another brand.",是,3,Jon Kohn,2024-09-26
US,B07R295MLS,R3L65RSLETIPI0,Gets caught on everything,Style: 11S Max,"This is my third robot vacuum, both of the other two were different brands. I fully understand robot vacuums don’t do well around obstacles such as rugs or furniture however, in the past the first one or two runs, it is easy to establish trouble areas within the household, figure out which rugs need to be picked up, etc.
<br>I have had this vacuum now for two weeks and I might as well vacuum the house manually for as much time as I spend saving this thing.
<br>I do not know that it is any shorter than my other models, but due to the suspension, it will squat and go under recliners, brace pieces On chairs and tables Only to get stuck because the brush is then pushed so far into the carpet it gets matted up.
<br>More on the small (horizontal brush) It is much longer than other models I have seen, and I think this attributes to the amount of tangling it does. Sometimes it stops the vacuum other times the brush gets tangled, and the vacuum moves on without it since it only pops on.
<br>This brush also gets caught on Every rug in the house As well as small transitions in the floor from one room to another (Other models I have seen tend to struggle with flimsy rugs or ones that don’t lay correctly, this one struggles even transitioning from hard floor to medium ply carpet.
<br>As I am writing this, it is currently trying to climb up the recliner for the third time while it cannot seem to make a successful transition when carpet is A quarter inch taller from one room to the next, it will give all of its battery life to attempt climbing over The inch and a half horizontal leg that sticks out from behind the recliner 2 inches.
<br>
<br>*** My Takeaway is that if I had not purchased this on sale, I would definitely send it back, but I did get a very good deal on it and I still have a couple more weeks to decide (I may keep it just to use for the dining room and robot proof one room of my house)
<br>This design could be improved greatly if it had two shorter horizontal brushes instead of one long one And if The programming Was more sensitive to being stuck it would do less damage to its brush and my carpet and be easier to rescue.",否,2,jameson,2024-09-26

<br>
<br>The ""con"" is that we typically only get about a year out of these. We run it daily and my family is not great about picking up socks and other things that can get sucked into it, so we are probably pretty hard on them. But I've purchased more expensive brands in the past and they don't seem to last that much longer (lots of moving parts that can fail) and they typically cost much more.

<br>I really like that it goes under the furniture (most of my furniture).
<br>Easy to empty and I do so when it occurs to me and is convenient to do so. It has yet to ""ask me"" to be emptied. I probably do it once a week or so when doing other chores.
<br>Quietest vacuum I've ever had (though also the smallest).
<br>Con:
<br>Doesn't get all the way into the corners, so one has to weep the corners out once in a while.
<br>Can get stuck under some furniture (in my case where I have a tapered toe kick board under a book case that it can sometimes wedge itself into).
<br>Has problems with electric cords and strings. Keep your space picked-up (just like Mommy told you to (in fairness, one has to do that for a regular vacuum as well)).

<br>4) Hair tangles way too easily in the brush. In fact, hardly any long hair makes its way into the dust bin, as it never gets past the brush roller.
<br>5) When cleaning multiple rooms, it often starts to lose energy far from its base, and then cannot seem to find its way back to the base before it totally runs out of power -- just randomly stopping anywhere.

(But I love it!),Style: 11S Max,"Having owned a ""first generation"" R---- vacuum back in the 2000's, I was skeptical of the whole genre of these devices that will eventually evolve to become our overlords. But I saw a EUFY suck up dog hair like a pro at a friend's house, so I bought one to give it a try. I must say, given the amount of cat hair it was able to remove from our carpet, I am impressed, and it usually parks itself back in the charger! The best bit is how it moves from our hardwood, onto a thick carpet and back. There are a few places it might get stuck in, but overall, it has been well worth the price. However, I am not sure the cats will ever forgive me.

He’s quiet, much more quiet than I figured he would be, and the battery lasts long enough for him to go over my entire place multiple times. He’s a little stupid, and will try to climb things that he definitely can’t and gets stuck sometimes, but the remote makes it easy to redirect him off a particularly high floor way transition or fan base. I still go through and get corners about once a week with a broom, but for keeping pet hair cleaned up on open hardwood floors and bathroom tile, he’s great. He sometimes gets lost on his way back to the base, but again the remote makes it easy to direct him on how to get back.

I have a household of furry critters, and the billowing dust bunnies used to reappear along the baseboards the same day that I vacuumed them up. This doesn't happen anymore.

<br>
<br>I am currently writing this while the vacuum attempts to go back to home base for charging by moving in the opposite direction of home base. Not sure how it thinks home base is outside of the house, but it’s trying its best. It does make it to home base like maybe 60-75% of the time unless it gets stuck.
<br>
<br>The suction is pretty decent and it’s certainly durable. It’s gotten stuck a few times and audibly fights for its survival before beeping for help. It sometimes detects furniture and avoids hitting it, other times it rams into planters and breaks them. It vacuums a lot up when it is vacuuming.
<br>
<br>Because it does not have mapping abilities, parts of the room sometimes don’t get vacuumed before the battery dies. Which brings me to the next point - the battery life is definitely getting shorter.

Being a cheapskate, I didn’t really commit until last week and bought this guy. It does take quite a while to fully charge, but letting it go for a while everyday makes it so much nicer in the home!! Just in the first day it sucked up way more than I thought we had hiding on our floors. And it gets under the couch!
<br>I definitely would love if this had an app so that I could customize it and all, but I went for the lowest price, so, I knew what I was getting. Super easy to set up, the only thing that I don’t like is the vents situation since I have to put something heavy over each one to prevent the vacuum from damaging itself. But, overall, I’m so happy with it! And it comes with a cleaning tool, which I’ve already used in the first week since my long hair is a menace. I’d say if you’re considering one, this is a good one!! I’m hoping to get 3-5 years out of it and I’d say it’s a good investment for that.

I run it almost every day and it helps tremendously with keeping ahead of the dirt and sand the dog tracks in.

US,B07R295MLS,R5TYHVBDDAKLR,Works much better than my old vacuum!,Style:11S Max,"The EUFY 11S Max vacuum is a major upgrade to the old vacuum I had, ILIFE V80 Max! It doesn't have one main feature that ILIFE V80 had and that's the ability to connect to my WiFi and thus be programmed to start at a certain time during the day or be controlled by me through their app if I'm away from the house. I really don't miss that feature at all and here's why. It was a pained to get the ILIFE vacuum to connect to my WiFi so every time it lost connection (very often) I had to jump through hoops to get it reconnect, lost password, pick which model you're connecting, blah, blah, blah! Also every time the vacuum went out to vacuum it would, 7 out of 10 times, not be able to return back home to it's docking station and would die somewhere in the house. Then I would have to go hunt through the house to find it and if it had been more than an hour the vacuum was totally dead, guess what...yep it lost it's connection to the WiFi so here comes the hoops!
<br>With the EUFY 11S Max I don't have these problems at all. Why? Glad you asked, because there's no WiFi connection! Nope you just use the included remote to pick a vacuum mode, I picked AUTO, and the vacuum does the rest! I programmed the time I want it to start vacuuming, 1pm, while we go out for lunch and nearly every time, 9 outta 10, we come home the vacuum is finished and back in it's dock!! Wow what a novelty, a vacuum that can find it's home!! However, if for some reason it isn't in it's dock and I do have to find it, it's had been easy to find because the ILIFE vacuum trained me very well! The EUFY also is a much better vacuum in that it picks up WAY MORE stuff than the ILIFE ever did and doing with only one rotary brush instead of two. The dirt chamber is a bit smaller than the ILIFE and because the EUFY is picking up more I do have to empty it more often, roughly every other day. We have a Shepard/Husky mix so there is a constant flow of fur! The only drawback with the EUFY is it is thinner than the ILIFE therefore it has found it's way into places the ILIFE never could get to and because of this sometimes it wedges itself in these spots and require removal from them. I've learn to block off those areas to prevent this. Overall, a really great vacuum!",否,5,Delzona,2024-08-20

At my advanced age, I need to stop moving furniture to clean, so the fact that Eufy runs smoothly under everything is a real health and safety benefit.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1W3X4958HZCUY,4.5/5 stars for performance,Color:Black,"Writing this review after using it for the first time.
<br>Likes: very easy to get it working in auto mode. Charging out of the box took about 2 hours, not too long for me. I ran it through my open kitchen + family room, dining room and front entryway. Took about 1.5 hrs to get the hardwood floors looking really good. It slso climbed my 0.75”H jute kitchen runners and gave those a nice clean. Was very easy to clean out the bin afterwards. The rolling brush was also very dirty with fluff and long hair, was able to clean it quickly and easily with the included tool.
<br>Dislikes: only 1 big annoyance - the side brush kept coming off when transitioning onto the kitchen runners, and when going over the flat metal feet of these modern lounge chairs in my family room. I had to reattach the brush over and over, at least ten times or more. I tried folding up the kitchen runners so it would skip them, even though I did want them vacuumed, but it was difficult to block off the chair feet. Quite a nuisance. A second, smaller issue - the vacuum seemed to have no idea where to go when I told it to head to the charging base from across the house. It tried for several minutes and was heading off into the wild blue yonder when I decided that it would be better to turn it off, carry it across the house to the trash to empty and clean it. The trash bin is about 14’ from the base, so when I turned it back on after cleaning, it had no problem finding the dock. I think this is what I will do from now on, instead of making it find its way home from one or two rooms away.
<br>
<br>Overall very pleased with it. The motor and beeps are louder than I was expecting based on reviews, but definitely less noisy than my old upright vac. If I hadn’t had to keep reattaching the brush, my floors would be dust-free with barely any effort from me.",否,5,GSM,2024-08-07

Now we keep it closed in each room and can no longer use it in our hallway.
<br>
<br>Now, I do clean the vacuum every sunday. We have a lot of pets we have a lot of hair I clean that off every week including the brush bar and the spinning brush so I do feel like for it to have this type of damage in 2 months is a bit extreme.

I’d asked Amazon’s AI Rufus several times in different ways if this model had two side brushes. Even shows in reviews. NOPE! Returning. Apparently Eufy considers this more economical (one side brush) and only older models have two. Dumb. You can tell from the bottom it used to have two, but it’s closed off. Bummer. I don’t like any vacuum cleaners with only one brush as it’s not as efficient. Boo for Eufy and Amazon for false advertising. Can’t figure how to get the pic here.",否,2,Ali P,2024-07-28

Eventually, it gets everything. It does not have a lot of bells and whistles. Mostly is just ping pongs around in random patterns. Eventually, it covers the whole space. It just may take a time or two to get all the spots. In the meantime, you will have a bunch of random triangle patterns in your carpet bias. Most of the time it finds it's way back to the charging station. But often I have to go find this labor-saving hockey puck. I tend to empty the bin after every use and wash the air filter.

US,B079QYYGF1,R22DD93WT996DI,We loved it...until we hated it.,,"The media could not be loaded.     We absolutely LOVED our eufy BoostI RoboVac 11S. It got under our couches, under our king size bed, and was constantly FULL of hair from our German Shepard and cats. I was well on its way to becoming my newest, bestest friend...until it cast itself in the role of ""frenemy"".
<br>
<br>Like most ""frenemies"" these little guys (yes, we liked the first one SO much, we bought a second one...it needed assistance as we brought home two more kittens) got cozy and became indispensable. Each day, like clockwork, they would leave their stations and begin making quick work around the house, getting each and every nook and cranny.
<br>
<br>After they lulled us into trusting them, they both committed the ultimate betrayal...death of the lithion ion battery. And both in under 6 months.
<br>
<br>The hours we had saved not having to vacuum for those 6 months, were then spent troubleshooting why these insolent betrayers would leave their stations, turn in a circle, and immediately redock without any sibilance of productivity. We used the app, we watched the videos, we read the instruction manual...and all we can come up with is that the battery life of these vacuums is less than 6 months.
<br>
<br>Please consider the cost of ownership of these and weigh if you would like to pay for new batteries every 6 months.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1EUMJJIOB6KC8,"quick pros and cons, have had one for about a year now",Color:Black,"pros:
<br> You can leave it alone and it will clean the area just give it time. no dust or dirt on the floor and you will notice the difference of the house floor in eyesight and feeling barefoot.
<br>
<br>its not loud in a living room but can be noticed in small areas like bedrooms. this is a personal take on the loudness as someone with sensitive ears
<br>
<br>every mode is useful but auto will take care of everything for you
<br>
<br>simple design to clean out parts. easily replacable parts as well for the roller brush and side brush
<br>
<br>will pick up all hair and dust off the floor if you let it. 3 cats in my house and no pet hair if i use this daily
<br>
<br>cons:
<br> like all robotic vacuums it can get stuck on mops and other clutter. if you have kids you feel like you have to move and pick up everything off the floor(to be fair you should do this anyways if you are going to use the vaccum).
<br>
<br>hair can get stuck on the main wheel and i dont believe you can take the wheel off to get inside. causing less time for the battery as it tries harder to push, easier to get suck under something with less power from the hair. the brushes are much easier to clean then around the wheel.
<br>
<br>personal take on the beeping noises. once again as someone with sensitive ears and difficulty concentrating. I dislike how loud the beeping is if the robot gets stuck. best to use this while you are awake and not have the automatic cleaning before you wake up or if you haven't picked up everything off your floor yet.

<br>I used to have a Roomba, years ago when they first came out. I loved it, it saved me so much time and was such a convenience. This vacuum performs just as nicely, but for a fraction of the cost! It has a lower profile than a lot of similar models and can go easily under a lot of furniture. Easy to empty the dustbin. Suction seems fine both on hard floors and on low rugs, which the vacuum navigates without issue.

Would I purchase it again…not sure at this point. But I wouldn’t say I’m dissatisfied with it. The drawbacks are: It does not have a handle to pick it up with which seems trivial but that’s an inconvenience to me. The only function without the remote is start/stop using the button on the vacuum itself so to run a spot clean, for example, you have to pick up the remote. It struggles with some clay cat litter on tile or slick floors and will scatter it. And there is no option for a room divider/wall barrier device. Some pros are that it is really quiet, low profile is great, and it will work on a rug with some black in it. All in all it is fine for what I use a robot vacuum for.",是,4,Bama Girl,2024-07-14

US,B07R295MLS,RQ2X7I9TOFMT0,"Works for Me! Floors noticeably cleaner, cat hair gone...",Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"I have been surprised by the price/performance of the Eufy 11s Max. I was never willing to pony up hundreds of dollars or (gasp!) $1,000+ for a robot vacuum. The $139 Eufy has made my entry into the world of robotic cleaning a good experience. In the past, I have relied on Rubbermaid's (Commercial) Microfibre 18"" mop and Bona hardwood cleaner. I still do for spills and mopping my upstairs hardwoods and vinyl planks on the ground floor.
<br>
<br>This modest Eufy 11s Max does a great job of picking up the cat hairs from 4 furry friends, tracked cat litter, dust and all the rest of the debris that magically accumulates on 3k sq. ft. of flooring. Its cleaning power improves and eases the way for any subsequent wet mop scenario.
<br>
<br>- Excellent along baseboards and thresholds, hardwoods, vinyl planking, under sofas
<br>- Quiet
<br>- Automatically increases suction power on carpets (iQ)
<br>- The remote control allows me to easily direct the 11s Max to different rooms I want to clean
<br>- Very good at avoiding falling down stairs
<br>- Renewable parts on this unit are easily available and reasonably priced
<br>- Ricochets around like a drunk...but knows its way ""home!""
<br>- Source of endless fascination for the cats
<br>
<br>-Not so good on Persian, Afghan or Caucasian carpets with fringe. (I fold them up or, in some cases, tuck the fringe under the carpet ends. I prefer to use a good vacuum with less brush action on fine carpets.) But the Eufy does a nice job on the underside of carpets, especially along the edges where dust, hair and debris seem to gather. Again, this is where the ""manual"" dimension of the remote control proves to be an actual advantage.
<br>
<br>I'm learning to clean, then shift boxes and other obstacles out of the way to allow other areas to get a better cleaning in alternate ""Auto"" sessions.
<br>
<br>My eyes and my bare feet tell me the Eufy 11s Max is doing a good cleaning job. The amount of cat hair in the disposal tray seconds that conclusion.
<br>
<br>It may not be the smartest, most powerful or ""very best"" robo vacuum you can buy but its great performance and $139 price tag speak to me.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it hasn't been able to explain why cats prefer hurling hairballs on my carpets instead of the hard flooring.",是,5,Amazon Customer,2024-07-12

US,B07R295MLS,R1S850Z85EYCMV,Handy vacuum,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,This was a great price for a vacuum. It was a bit horrifying how much it picked up the first few times I used it. It is low enough to go under the couches and can get over small obstacles. I really wish it had something to stop it getting stuck though. It has gotten partly under an arm chair and a wall unit and then got itself wedged. I've learned to tip the chair up and block the bottom of the wall unit and then it's fine. It's also gotten stuck on a floor vent. It's pretty quiet and unobtrusive and does a great job of cleaning. It doesn't have a big compartment so has to be emptied fairly often. It takes a while to fully charge back up. Overall I'm very pleased with it as it saves me a lot of work. It would be 5 stars except for having to block things off where it will get stuck.,否,4,Tanya,2024-07-12

US,B07R295MLS,R37FTT9887AECA,Great value! Eufy is hardworking!,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"I just renovated a 1960s rancher, and had to move in while reno was still ongoing. Needless to say, there was and is lots of dust. To add to the mix, I have three cats whose favorite hobby is shedding. A 60 year old, self-avowed cat lady, I could not keep up with the dust and hair. I had a Shark robo vac which I used on a carpeted floor. It did not do a great job, and I was constantly getting messages that Lurch's sidewheel was stuck, usually under a king sized bed. I would have to rake it out from under with a golf club. The Shark also left cat hair in the carpet. I took the Shark, along with my three cats, to my Florida condo where there was no carpet. The Shark still got stuck, could never find its dock, and just didn't do a great job cleaning.
<br>
<br>This Eufy beats that Shark like a drum! I have no carpet in this house, but do have a couple of washable rugs. Eufy does a great job on the LVP, hardwoods, and rugs alike. The only time it has gotten stuck was when it sucked up an electrical cord. Its bumper is more sensitive than the Shark's, so Eufy doesn't push lightweight items around.
<br>
<br>Eufy was easy to set up, and did a good 30 minute run right out of the box. There's a remote control with it, and a nifty tool for cleaning the brush. The instruction book is a bit vague on what all you can get it to do, and the icons in the book didn't match up with the ones on the remote, but I haven't used the remote for it yet, as it runs perfectly by just pushing the go button on Eufy's back.
<br>
<br>It sucks up and collects all the cat hair it can find, and is still getting its share of construction gerbis. I thought I would never be able to walk barefoot in this house, but Eufy has changed that!
<br>
<br>Eufy finds its dock when the charge gets low. Its low profile enables it to get under sofas and chairs.
<br>
<br>The collection tank is easy to empty and clean. The brush is easy to remove, and the tool makes for easy and quick cleaning of it.
<br>
<br>Eufy is reasonably quiet.
<br>
<br>My only complaint is that Eufy doesn't sense stairs and drop offs like my old Shark. The first time I turned Eufy on, it raced straight for the sun room doors, and over the edge-a good 6 inch drop-and landed on its back like a dying bug. The construction is strong enough to withstand the drop, but I block off that opening when Eufy is now on the job.
<br>
<br>Eufy's full charge gives a long run time that will clean a good 1000 feet of space.
<br>
<br>Overall, Eufy is a powerful little vac, and well worth the price. There's no app, like with the Shark, but you can set it to run with the remote.
<br>
<br>If you have hard floors and pets, don't hesitate to get this thing!
<br>
<br>Caveat: I cannot attest to how much cat weight Eufy will support, as I cannot get mine to ride it.",是,5,Avid Reader,2024-07-11

US,B079QYYGF1,RXP6BSRSQJASP,my life is easier because of eufy,Color:Black,"The Eufy 11S (Slim) Robot Vacuum Cleaner has been a game-changer in my household, offering exceptional cleaning performance and convenience. Its BoostIQ technology automatically increases suction power when extra vacuuming strength is needed, ensuring thorough cleaning on various surfaces from hard floors to medium-pile carpets.
<br>
<br>One of the standout features is its slim design, allowing it to effortlessly navigate under furniture and in tight spaces where traditional vacuums struggle to reach. This makes cleaning hassle-free and ensures no corner is left untouched.
<br>
<br>I appreciate how quiet the 11S operates, making it possible to run it during the day or even at night without disrupting activities or sleep. Its self-charging capability is also convenient, as it automatically returns to its base to recharge when the battery runs low, ready for the next cleaning session.
<br>
<br>The vacuum's powerful suction effectively picks up dirt, debris, and pet hair, leaving floors spotless. The dustbin is easy to empty, and maintenance is minimal.

This Eufy does not do that. It can climb over the transition from hard floor to carpet just fine, and if it comes to an obstacle it just changes direction. It is not a high end model (no mopping, doesn't self empty), but I am plenty satisfied. Not saying it never has hung up on anything (dog toys, stray socks, etc.) but I can't fault it for that.

It goes right over all of my low pile rugs too. The pictures is what it picked up in just a couple days! 🥴 Only con is sometimes it gets stuck under the couch, but hey it’s cleaning under there and that’s not something I would be doing regularly so I don’t mind that much 😂

US,B07R295MLS,REN5CYN8Z194B,Gets Stuck Too Often,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"I had high hopes for this vacuum. If you have a room with no furniture, no small rugs, and nothing but a floor, this will work quite well. It does pick up pet hair and other dust quite well, but I constantly had to babysit this thing. It frequently got stuck under a living room chair, under the recliner and under the sofa. I got tired of lifting up the furniture to get the thing out. It beeps loudly when it's stuck! It also got caught up on the corner of small rugs. It's quite powerful as it bumps into things and the result is that if there is anything that is not super heavy, like a plant stand, it will move it and/or knock it over. If I have to move everything, pick up all throw rugs, and physically block off areas where I know it will get stuck, it is just not worth it! So disappointing. I'm returning it.",否,2,D A,2024-06-24

We have 2 dogs and 2 kids. I have 2 Eufy vacs and 1 Roomba. The Roomba is junk! That thing ran into everything and barely picked up anything. The Eufy brand is definitely my favorite! I have had my 2 Eufy vacs for 5 yrs and they're still going strong! So I got rid of the Roomba and got a 3rd Eufy! My only worry is this one only has 1 brush on the side. My other 2 has a brush on each side. But it will still do the job. Don't waste your money on those high cost robot vacuums when you have this brand that does a much better job for the fraction of the cost. I change the brushes and filters every 2 weeks. I run them twice a day. I buy the replacement brushes and filters from Amazon. I get a brand that's compatible with Eufy vacs. I know the suction works because the dirt compartments are completely after each run.

<br>
<br>It doesn't have any 'smart' features, but my original Roomba was just as dumb and was a miracle machine, so I don't complain. Suction is very good. To use the timed program feature, be sure the remote is in line of sight to the machine, because the program is in the remote, not in the vacuum.
<br>
<br>It's very quiet! Also it is very low to the ground, and so doesn't get stuck in places where the Roomba would always get jammed.
<br>
<br>BE SURE TO CLEAN AND REMOVE HAIR FROM THE ROLLER BRUSH WITH EACH USE
<br>I have four cats, and the Eufy picks up their fur very well. But the fur gets twisted on the ends of the roller brush and forms a felted pad that pushes the roller out of its square socket just a bit. This causes it not to engage well with the drive socket cup, and so the square end slips a little. That slippage causes rapid wear, eventually making the roller brush nonfunctional. So be sure to keep that part clean.",是,5,Amazon Customer,2024-06-20

US,B07R295MLS,R12MH0G9OMMEV2,Eufy RoboVac 11s Max Review: Reliability,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"I've been using the Eufy RoboVac 11s Max for over two years now, and it continues to impress with its durability and performance. This robot vacuum might not be the smartest when it comes to navigating around furniture — it often gets caught under the same pieces repeatedly. However, where it lacks in navigation, it makes up for in suction power and reliability.
<br>
<br>**Pros:**
<br>- **Great Suction Power:** The Eufy RoboVac 11s Max excels in picking up dust, dirt, and debris from various surfaces, making it a reliable cleaner for everyday use.
<br>- **Durable Build:** Despite its occasional mishaps under furniture, the vacuum is sturdy and has proven to be long-lasting over the years.
<br>- **Exceptional Customer Service:** Dealing with Eufy's customer service has been a breeze. They are responsive, helpful, and ensure that any issues are promptly addressed.
<br>
<br>**Cons:**
<br>- **Limited Navigation Features:** It lacks advanced navigation features such as mapping capabilities or the ability to set no-go zones via a smartphone app.
<br>- **Random Cleaning Pattern:** The vacuum moves in a random pattern rather than following straight lines, which can lead to some areas being cleaned more thoroughly than others.
<br>
<br>**Conclusion:**
<br>The Eufy RoboVac 11s Max is a solid choice for anyone looking for a dependable robot vacuum with excellent suction power and robust build quality. While its navigation quirks may require occasional manual intervention, its overall performance and exceptional customer service make it a worthwhile investment.",是,5,SB2,2024-06-19

US,B07R295MLS,RKDLSCMLJQLCL,"Third Time's a Charm, or Three Times a Lady",Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"I love this vacuum cleaner! It is the third robotic vacuum I’ve had and is by far my favorite. (I named her Hazel III after the maid in the old comic strip.) I can see why it’s the best-selling robotic vacuum on Amazon. One of the reasons I bought it is that I already have a Eufy rechargeable stick vacuum, which is also wonderful and well made. The other robotic vacs I had were an iRobot Roomba and a Roborock. Here are my reasons for loving Hazel III:
<br>1. It’s very quiet.
<br>2. It’s very lightweight.
<br>3. It’s a lower height than the other vacuums so that it fits under more furniture than the others did.
<br>4. It’s well made with quality parts and a nice finish.
<br>5. It’s simple to figure out.
<br>6. It’s easy to clean. The only thing that takes a bit of time is the main brush, since I have two long-haired cats and need to untangle their hair from the brush. However, the brush does not have small pieces on each end that fall into the wastebasket and need to be fished out when it’s being cleaned. Also, the parts fit back together easily after they’re cleaned.
<br>7. It doesn’t give false signals, like telling me the filter and brush need to be cleaned when it really needs to be recharged. In fact, it doesn’t talk at all, which is refreshing for a change.
<br>8. It’s very reasonably priced.
<br>9. The remote and vacuum itself have legends on them to explain what the icons and the beeps mean.
<br>10. Even though it only works for 90 minutes on standard suction and doesn’t then recharge and go out again, it seems to remember where it’s been and doesn’t always head off in the same direction.
<br>11. Even though three feet of clearance is recommended for it to find the docking station, I wanted to put it in the knee hole of a kitchen cabinet desk, which doesn’t have three feet of clearance, but the vacuum often finds its way back, regardless. If it doesn’t, I just place it in front of the docking station, push the button, and it docks itself.
<br>12. The manual is actually written in good, clear English, as opposed to a slipshod translation from Chinese, which is a very refreshing change.

US,B07R295MLS,R2XCDW26R1KLZ,Repeated Reliability Issues with Eufy Vacuums,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"Unfortunately this was the second model of Eufy vacuum we had to have a battery fail after circa one year of use. Previously their customer support sent a replacement battery (for our first model, a 30C) because it failed so close to the end of the warranty. For this unit, an 11S Max, we called for warranty support less than a week after the warranty expired (according to their policy), Eufy confirmed the battery was the issue, and their customer support, via a supervisor, would not offer a replacement. We had the unit less than a year based on receipt date but not order date, but their policy is order date so no support was offered. Having this verbatim experience with another Eufy model, a battery failing at essentially the end of the warranty period, my staunch advice is to not order from this brand. I say this because my family has had other suppliers, specifically Shark and iRobot, which didn’t have these reliability issues and the mistake I made was trusting my first experience with a Eufy vacuum was an anomaly. This (second) experience shows it was not.

<br>Their support team is active on this site so I expect them to respond here but note the feedback above and the support situation explained.

US,B07R295MLS,R1FKGTOVBX9V68,Solid basic vac,Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"This is the most stripped-down no-frills robovac that has only one function and no features, but it does what it's supposed to do. I have a more advanced robot, but the lidar blimp makes it taller, so I still use the 11s max in some areas due to its slim profile. Since it has no navigation ability and just bumps around, I usually just lock it in a smaller room until the battery runs out (it's about 90 min on lowest suction and maybe 25 min on max). I don't use it unless I'm home because it gets stuck or lost all the time. The bristled brush style is terrible for long hair, I wish they had a rubber brush version, especially since it does absolutely nothing on carpets anyway - the daily hair removal is my biggest pet peeve on this machine. It does work well on hard floors and picks up a surprising amount of dust and debris from a small space that's cleaned daily. It definitely cleans better under my low bed than I do with a canister because I can't see anything underneath, and the bot spends a lot of time bumping from one support to another to really attack those dust bunnies.
<br>
<br>If you want something that avoids obstacles or cleans systematically, you need to look elsewhere. If you just want something to control dust between full cleanings, it will do the job. Don't plan on quick spot cleaning either as it the spiral pattern blows more dirt away than into the vac.",是,4,Alessya,2024-04-07
US,B07R295MLS,R2BNIGDQEWAN4A,"Good value, but requires patience",Size:5.73 pounds | Color:Black | Style:11S MAX,"My 2 cats and I recently moved from a 3 bedroom house to a small 2 bedroom apartment. And even though I vacuum around their box every day when I clean it and I don’t wear shoes inside, the floor was getting visibly dirty within a day or two. So, having the Eufy vacuum every day is definitely helping to control the fur and dirt. And it’s able to vacuum both floors and area rugs with no problem. However, it can get hung up on electrical cords, thin scatter rugs (like the bath mat), and other things close to the floor (it pruned the lowest leaves off my big philodendron). So you have to “child proof” to minimize this, but unless you have no floor lamps in the house, it will get stuck once in a while. And it will move light items like dining chairs and the cat dishes when it bumps them. This is only a minor nuisance until it sloshes the water bowl and then sucks up and spreads the water, making a worse mess than it cleans. Again this can be avoided by “child proofing”, but it’s a bit annoying.
<br>
<br>Finally, although it is less work than getting out the big vacuum every other day, it needs to be emptied daily. So you can’t leave it alone for more than a day. It also needs to be cleaned weekly, but the included cleaning tool works very well, so it only takes me 5 minutes or so.
<br>
<br>I still get out the big vacuum once a week to get the spots Eufy can’t get to, but overall it is helping keep the floor looking and feeling cleaner. But now that I’ve lived with it for about a month, I wish I’d bought a slightly fancier model that learns not to run into things.

I loved my previous Eufy and thought I was buying the same exact model, as I clicked on the buy again link on my Amazon account. Unfortunately, they made some changes that were not for the better. Instead of having 2 sweeping arms to pull dirt into the middle to be sucked up, it now only has 1. I was very disappointed to see this change. Also, my unit came with no sweeping arms, so I used one I already bought for my older one. I do like that this is controlled by a remote that sits on the docking station. I set it and it runs as scheduled daily. I like this better than my internet controlled vacuum as it has less issues since I don't have to worry about it connecting/disconnecting from the internet. Hopefully it works sufficiently with only the 1 sweeper arm. Im not sure I'd have bought this model had I realized this. Hopefully it still works well.",是,4,Jmesco,2024-04-07

However, it got lost in our bathroom or under our couch and would spend it's whole battery cleaning in there. It was never able to roll up over the threshold to the kitchen. Even though put the dock in the kitchen, it would immediately leave the room. (It was never able to get back to the dock on it's own.)
<br>After about a month, the roller brush made an awful noise. (Yes, I cleaned every four or five days.) It was so loud we couldn't run it when we were home. Then all the bristles in the side brush fell out.
<br>Finally the vacuum insisted on running at 6:09 a.m., even though the program was set for 11 a.m. I couldn't stand being woken up by the loud suction and banging from a list vacuum that didn't actually clean the floors. It is now retired.",否,1,Miriam,2024-04-07

<br>
<br>It got delivered and I set it up. The first run was amazing. It ran for about an hour and picked up a crap ton of dirt, hair and toddler debris. I was seriously impressed. I had it on a schedule and was ready for its next adventure.
<br>The second run, it died trying to find the base. I found it dead in the hallway. I was surprised but not bothered. I put it on the charger and eagerly awaited its next cycle.
<br>It hasn’t been able to leave the charger since.

Cons: small dust cup compared to my Shark Navigator, when the description states that there is no mapping feature it translates operationally to the vacuum doing under the table 4 times and missing vast parts of the hall (as an example), it wanders aimlessly. Recommended as a budget pick by Wired. Our house is 1800 sf open concept. I closed the doors to the 3 bedrooms &amp; bathroom so that the vacuum would sweep only the kitchen, living, dining and main hall area which is where dirt is tracked and dog/cat spend time. It swept well in the areas where it went but missed complete swaths of the area I had hoped it would clean. Never intended this vacuum to replace my upright, rather wanted it to keep a lid on debris dragged in by the dog. This vacuum may work for a smaller area or apartment dweller.

It randomly bounces around the room, making random lines as it goes. The other setting is a spot clean when it goes in a spiral pattern, but that doesn't work for whole rooms. It stops after a few spirals and it keeps to a pretty strict spiral pattern, so it can't get around objects. For the price and ""dumbness"" (not wifi connected or anything), it's decent. The vacuuming effectiveness is good. I wish it had a setting to find a wall and follow it and go back and forth. As it is, it'll randomly go into other rooms and, depending on the room, be there most of the time until it finds its way out lol",是,4,Kenny Joseph,2024-02-24

The robovacuum does well navigating around LOTS of obstacles around my living and dining rooms and finds its way to the charging station 99% of the time.

At first it worked great. I would clean the vacuum every day and washed the filter every few days. I bought a few filter replacements and additional brushed, and would changed it every 4 months or so. Just over a year of owning, the vacuum started giving me issues. First was the three beeps. I went insane trying to fix the issue. I ended up un assembling the vac and brushing off the dust and debris accumulated over the past year. It worked like a charm and thought that was the end and may have to do that again in another 12 months. In December, I noticed the vacuum would die in random parts of my house. It wouldn’t make it back to its docking area. I bought it a new battery and once again, I thought “another 12 months”. Wrong! Two months later (yesterday), I got the blasted 3 beeps again! I un assembled it, cleaned it out and thought it would work… it did not. I opened it 3 more times to assume that I has connected the parts correctly. Still wont work.

I literally haven't had to sweep or vacuum my house by hand since I've hired her. She's a tad bit noisy and she bangs into things but it's not annoying.

It does a great job with suction on most surfaces, and has a wonderful battery life, but it absolutely not a good choice to send out on auto cleaning. It gets caught on the slightest ledge, eats cat toys even if they are put away (it tips baskets) and while it fits easily under most surfaces, it will often get ""stuck"" under a surface just because it loses contact with the remote and has to move on auto. The accident detection is non-existent, and the thing has now started making its own auto schedule, vacuuming in the middle of the night if we don't physically fully power it down after every use. While there is a setting for scheduling the robot, there is no programming put into the remote for this to occur for, and it seems to be a different time every day (11:56pm, 2:28 am, etc). This morning was the last straw, when it went off at 4:43 am and immediately tried to tip my PC tower while we were asleep. I will be looking into other options, as it seems to me it defeats the purpose of having a robot vacuum when you have to put the same amount of work into functioning it as a regular vacuum plus MORE work to turn it off and make sure it stays off. It was a fine temporary solution for taking care of dusty vinyl floors and as a first vacuum that would initially substitute to create a little less effort, but it has now become too much work.

This one was purchased after replacing carpet on the first floor with hard floors. Works great! The battery life is sufficient, sweeps corners and edges well, avoids obstacles that might be damaged by getting sucked up (except charging cords which it will gladly eat). It's so helpful to be able to turn the vac on and go about other chores while it does its thing! Perfect for all over vac or a quick, directed clean up. I wasn't sure how well it would actually vaccuum my area rugs so after a few runs with the Eufy I pulled out the big vaccuum and went over the rugs only to find that the Eufy was doing a fine job of picking up all that dust, dirt and dog hair from the rugs. So glad to have these!
<br>They are so effective and helpful. I've never set the scheduled clean I just push the auto button whenever and Eufy picks up the floors while I'm busy (or not).

We have 2 cats and it was the primary reason we purchased it. We do our bedroom twice a week, move it with the dock to the living room and do it once a week. We plan to do the whole house once a month as we have been doing to get corners and under things that the robovac doesn't get. It really helps to keep the hair and cat dander down. The only negative we have and it's kinda minor is that at the end of a session it only finds the charging dock about half the time. We find it in corners, under dining room chairs and other tight areas. We have found it stuck under furniture and we understand that. For example today we set it up in the living room. Off it went. About 75 minutes later the vacuum shut down and it appeared to be looking for the dock. It found the wall and began working it's way toward the dock. Got almost there just on the other side of the kitchen island. Rather than continue toward the dock it slowed down even more, turned around and headed back the route it came from. I turned it off, picked it up, moved it to the other side of the island, hit home on the remote and it made its way to the dock. All that said, are we confusing it by moving it to do other areas start to finish? Bottom line it does a very good job. It's easy to clean. Hope it last a long time.

Now the beeps and light indicated “stuck bumper.” So apart it came and back together again. As I write this, it runs. And there are no beeps except for the occasional one indicating that it is caught under a cabinet or such.
<br>On December 31st I ordered a replacement since I vowed not to take my first one apart again.
<br>Upon unpacking the unit and setting it up my husband stated that it only had one side brush. I didn’t realize that fact was written in the description. (My old Eufy has one brush now too-other one is MIA)
<br>Old Eufy just finished and is making its way back to the dock. Poor thing must have a slight case of dementia. It just can’t do it. Oh, well. We all need help sometimes..

I should have gotten one of these years ago. The mere fact that I, personally, do not have to do the actual vacuuming makes this worth all the money. But it really shines in its ability to pick up fine dust, dirt, and my incessantly shedding hair. It works great on carpet, area rugs, anti-fatigue mats, and hard floors. It's super easy to clean. I did buy the extra filter, brush roll, and spinning cleaner thing. I also love that it comes with a cleaning tool.

It has no method to its madness so 100 minutes doesn’t clean the 1,200 square feet of the downstairs of my house. I’d be happy with two rooms. I contacted service and the tech support guy acted like he had no idea what to say. He said maybe try turning on some lights. My house is a basic colonial so nothing unusual about it. After all these great reviews I thought this was capable of much more. It does clean well. Still debating on whether to send it back. Maybe I just got a defective one.

US,B07R295MLS,R3C242Z9H320RN,"a little frustrating, needs babysitting",Color:Black | Style:11S Max,"product claim: different 'versatile' modes.
<br>actual: sort of. Spot clean does a spiral until it bumps something and goes into auto. Edge mode is nice but will keep doing the same edges until you set another mode. Auto and Quick clean have no discernable difference. Auto and quick clean both switch between edges and wander so often that it ends up cleaning the edges 8 times while leaving debris in the center of the room.
<br>Product claim: boost IQ suction control.
<br>actual: I haven't seen it adjust to much to bigger messes. It stays pretty steady in boost IQ mode. Since a larger mess requiring more suction is a job for the spot clean mode, this seems pointless. All modes that aren't AUTO engage the fan to high or need user to set it. This includes spot clean.
<br>Product claim: good for animal/human hair
<br>actual: This does get hair off the ground, but it all just winds up on the brush, so be ready to cut hair out of the brush a lot, like way a lot. Once there is a lot of hair in the brush, it seriously impacts its ability to remove debris larger than dust motes.
<br>
<br>My impression: I babysit this more than I should have to. I've seen bounce nav robot vacs in this price range at least keep track of where its been. This will vac the same corner a hundred times while leaving dust in the center of the room. Its constantly getting itself stuck. In order to get it to complete a room, like the kitchen, to my satisfaction, i have to wall it into the kitchen and guide it through its modes one by one, then after about 45 minutes it does an adequate job. My kitchen takes me about 3 minutes to sweep myself. Evaluate how much you practically need this before you buy it. It doesn't save a whole lot of time, effort, or money. I wish things like this would receive regular firmware updates as reviews start to come in and people identify potential issues.",是,3,sean,2024-01-03
US,B07R295MLS,R3UWLIH2NM2QVZ,WARNING: Battery EXPECTED to only last 1 year!!,Color:Black | Style:11S Max,"I’ve had my vacuum for about 12 months and a few weeks. It has been working well up until recently. It now dies after about 5 minutes of cleaning and doesn’t return to the base. Seems like an obvious battery issue. So I called Eufy and they told me I need to buy a new battery! I said it’s only been a year and the representative told me that the expected battery life is about 1 year! (See photo of email from Eufy support)
<br>
<br>So the company itself only expects it to last less than 2 years and it’s now just a few weeks out of warranty. I cannot believe that a product has an expected life of only 1 year+. It didn’t come close to the 500 cycle upper limit they expected and they still won’t replace the battery. They essentially told me that I need to purchase a new battery every year.
<br>
<br>The remote also never worked properly but once I got the timer set I rarely used it so I ignored the issues there.

<br>Effective little vacuum that is definitely WAY quieter than my prior vacuum. Which is a big plus for those of us that work from home more often than we used to. In its first couple runs, it seems to be effective.
<br>The Cons:
<br>No Wifi/app connection. Can't select specific days to clean, can only select a time (so it cleans every day at the set time and you can cancel if you don't want it to run). The remote is a little cumbersome to learn/program. It isn't terribly efficient, runs for nearly 2 hours in my 4-room downstairs. Though I guess that indicates good battery life.

<br>I have had Dufy for 3 years now. He has a 90 minute run time, 3 suction modes, and can be set on a schedule. I would never leave him unattended - he isn't the smartest! I have to empty him multiple times during his run time. Otherwise, he deposits dog hair on transitions, carpets, and rugs.
<br>
<br>He is not very ""smart."" He gets stuck on the small transition from the laminate to the hearth. Instead of backing up and trying a different way, he just goes and goes until I redirect him. There is also no rhyme or reason to his navigation, he just goes willy nilly. AND, he can't find his home very easily. I end up using the remote to guide him in the general direction of home and then he can get there.
<br>
<br>He is definitely a maintenance vacuum, not a replacement for a regular vacuum. If I haven't been home to run him, I definitely need to use my traditional vacuum and use this one for maintenance.

<br>-After a full charge, it worked for 90 minutes before it headed back to the charger.
<br>-It is relatively quiet. My previous Eufy G30 with the same suction power was louder.
<br>-It gets on the charger smoothly and quickly. I have another Eufy which takes 3 minutes to reposition in front of its charger.

<br>The bads.
<br>-There is no mapping. It cleaned randomly. It missed many spots.

I am VERY happily impressed with this vac. It does not have the mapping I've seen on the more expensive models, and with the couple hallways in my home, that might have been helpful, but it does an awesome job of picking up the dog/cat hair, the lady beetles, and even the cat food if I forget to gate that off. :-) The dust cup is small, but not too small for it to be a problem if I forget to dump before the next day. The suction is actually picking up stuff I'm embarrassed to know is in my rug (YUCK) but the other beautiful part is that as long as you take out the little filter, the dust cup can be easily rinsed out. It has not fallen down any steps, though it did get 'hung up' on the top step it's first time out. The only drawback I can think of is that I would have preferred to be able to schedule the days of the week instead of it running every day.

<br>The second one I got (G30) is simply great. My home has 4 levels, so One level gets swept at night and I move it to one of the other levels during the day so it will have a chance to re-charge during the day.
<br>On Cyber Monday I decided to buy this Robovac exclusively for the only carpeted level of the house. While it has GREAT suction and does an excellent job it does have a few drawbacks.
<br>This one does not connect to the internet (which my G30 does). It vacuums in a random path rather than in straight lines (as long as the carpet gets cleaned, who cares). But the biggest drawback is the fact that it does not seem to have a drop sensor. Consequently, if I do not block the stairway, it tries to commit suicide. Next time I guess I will look for one more like the G30 as far as features go (seems they don't make the G30 anymore).

<br>I bought this (from Walmart) to keep cat hair and dust levels down. It will not replace a full vacuum but is much quieter and is surprisingly excellent at most other things. However, it is trixie - it will escape rooms by sneaking under couches about 80% of the time but gets stuck down there the other 20% of the time. It transitions almost seamlessly from carpet to tile to short pile rugs. It also transitions to high pile rugs relatively well and often rescues itself from situations where I expect it to get stuck, like the base of the cat tree. However, it sometimes gets the side brush stuck under things, like the edge of a rug, and leaves it behind. It does move randomly but manages to cover most of my living room in 20 minutes or so. Despite the bump-and-turn strategy, it is surprisingly gentle about it - it has hit the stand where I keep my cats water bowl without making it spill. I gave it several feet of clearance to reach the dock and it has no trouble navigating to it around furniture and things, but might need a little bit of help if it's coming from a different room. It usually has to repark itself about 5 times, which I think is fun because I have to do that too (😂). The remote is easy to use once you figure out the buttons (the names and pictures don't necessarily match with those in the product manual, but the functions are the same) and the arrows are helpful for redirecting it away from obstacles without having to get up and move it. I love the quick clean/one room function, which cleans for 30 minutes before stopping. However, I still have to tell it to park after it's finished, it doesn't seem to do that on it's own unless the battery is low. I wouldn't feel comfortable letting it run while I'm away or asleep, but I would set it up in one room to run while I'm getting ready for work or bed and could keep half an eye on it.

A month ago the right sensors got damaged and it was spinning in circles so I went on and decided to order a new one. Well, this is not it. On their 3D video it shows a vacuum with two side brushes, this one came with only one side brush. I guess this is the new ""improved"" model. I was OK, whatever, let me give it a try. Charged it and turned on. It barely picks stuff up and my house is all tile with only one very thin area rug. It attempted multiple times to go under the couches (18"" clearance) but I guess the sensors were ""thinking"" that the shade of either couch is an obstacle and it would turn back around. That's fine but then the vacuum goes on and bumps left, right and center into chairs legs, the media center, walls. From there randomly would stop in the middle of the room and would start beeping like it's stuck or tangled but there is nothing of the sort. I would double check to make sure that everything is ok then start it again and the same thing would happen 10 min later. It's definitely noisier than my older unit. The last straw was when it went over a couple of candy sprinkles (my children were decorating Thanksgiving cookies) and didn't pick any of them up, so this unit is going back. I used to recommend Eufy to everybody. Three of my friends even bought the older model with the two side brushes and they love them but I guess the time to look for a new brand has come.

US,B07R295MLS,R5HZLLTNHSFJ7,Dumbest Robot Alive,,"It’s super cool as a robot vacuum. It’s decent in the sense that it does a chore while I’m not doing it. Otherwise, this thing is like a robot that was dropped on his head on the product line. It routinely runs into us. Literally like it’s resentful, it takes aim. It will run OVER our toes. Not pleasant and again, it will just divert paths to do this. If we have something like a package propped against a wall, the robot seems to sense that it’s unsteady and will bump into it until it gets knocked over — will bump it 12 to 15 times, easily. If I send it in the direction of my living room, and go into my bedroom to feed the dogs, suddenly it needs to be in the bedroom, in the specific corner I set up their food bowls. Honestly, it’s either dumb or smartly programmed to annoy us equally as much as it cleans up.
<br>
<br>Other major con: battery life. Our house is incredibly small and we run it five days a week because it lasts no more than 90 minutes — this basically means it completes 500 ish square feet and needs to charge 3 hours to do the other 500. I got this during a prime sale and don’t feel too bad about this purchase but if I had paid full price I would be seething — not worth it for that.",是,2,scarlett Heydt,2023-10-14

I contacted the Eufy manufacturer directly and was told they no longer include the side brushed in the package. Instead, they offered me a 25% discount on purchase of the side brushes.

It recently started making a loud clicking noise when it goes over carpet and I cannot figure out where it’s coming from. The most recent issue is that it runs maybe 5-10 mins max before it stops and starts beeping. It’s not stuck on anything it just randomly stops in its tracks and stops working so it never finishes a full cycle of vacuuming. When it was in full working condition it was awesome and did its job well, but I think for an item this pricey it should have lasted longer than 1.5 years.",否,3,Veronica,2023-10-04

Another time under my couch. And another time on a door threshold.
<br>
<br>It seems the vacuum doesn't have a good gauge of what it can or can't do. Instead of displaying logic to help it know when to not try to overcome an obstacle, instead it would try and then get stuck. Or when it went under the couch and met resistance - instead of backing out, it pushed further under, getting itself stuck.

<br>Every morning, after it ran overnight, I'd find a half-completed job and it stuck somewhere.

US,B07R295MLS,R7WQHM1397UA1,Brilliant purchase,,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;We absolutely love our Eufy. I had never heard of this brand and my sister in Australia told me about her Eufy. I’d never considered buying a robo-vac thinking why do I need that? I can just vacuum … until a sudden medical situation put me on limitations and I can’t vacuum for a prolonged period. That’s when our Eufy joined the family. This little guy does a great job of roaming around vacuuming but you can use the remote and manually direct him or have him concentrate on a small area in a circular pattern (eg for a spill). The sound is not intrusive and is far quieter than our regular vacuum. Our cat is terrified of the vacuum but is fine with the Eufy. It picks up cat hair, people hair and even cat litter. It is powerful and persistent enough to knock over a bowl of water (the cat’s water) so you need to pick up obvious hazards. It can navigate easily between floor surfaces. I have included a brief video of the Eufy going from faux hardwood to carpet to a rug. He senses the top of the carpeted stairs and turns around and has not had any tumbles. He will stop and beep with different colored lights flashing to signal the problem - help I’m stuck through to something is stuck in my roller or I need emptying, which is easy to do. When he needs charging he goes back to his home base. You can also manually control that too. Unlike the roller brush on a regular vacuum cleaner, they have thoughtfully designed this to allow you to easily pop out the roller brush and included a clever tool for both cutting out hair (similar to a letter opener) and picking/brushing out bits. I can’t believe how much value there is in such a relatively inexpensive robo vacuum. Although I had a personal recommendation, I still read many reviews including the comparisons with Roomba and I still chose this Eufy and I am so happy I did.",是,5,Conscientious Mom,2023-10-01

US,B07R295MLS,R2Q8NQOP9AL43V,"Not perfect, but honestly I love this vacuum cleaner",,"Okay! So, I ordered this vacuum cleaner about eight months ago. Quick take-home message:
<br>
<br>-- Better on carpet at first than it is now, but much much MUCH better than not vacuuming, so there's that. Does a surprisingly good job getting pet hair out of the carpet. Maybe I should mention I have six dogs and two kittens. I use the big vacuum cleaner now and then, but not very often. Oh, and the pets are completely unbothered by the robot vacuum clearer. The kittens literally lie there and let it nudge them until it gives up and goes a different direction. If the vacuum clearer catches a fluffy spaniel tail, it turns itself off till I get there and gently extract the tail in question.
<br>
<br>-- After two months or so, the vacuum cleaner started making a really loud noise. After going back and forth with the company, they decided the problem was the roller and sent me a new one. Boom, instant quiet. After a few months, the problem recurred, but now that I know it's the roller, I tuck a bit of tissue in with the roller as I replace it, and that is easy and solves the problem completely.
<br>
<br>-- Really simple, to use, and really good design. I'm honestly very impressed with how easy it is to take all the parts off and clean them with the little cleaning tool provided and put them back (even with adding a bit of tissue as I replace the roller).
<br>
<br>-- I use this vacuum cleaner every single day, sometimes twice. I never let it run when I'm not home -- if you have pets, I bet you can guess why -- and I put the charger downstairs, out of reach of puppy teeth. But it's just no trouble to go downstairs and get it, bring it up and let it run, then clean it and put it back on the charger.
<br>
<br>I don't know what I did without it. I'm really glad the price of robot vacuum cleaners came down to the point I was willing to try one. If it broke, I'd sob and buy another one immediately. I'm rating every single specific aspect as a four, but the overall rating is a five because even if it isn't perfect, I love it.
<br>
<br>If someone comes up with a drone that flies around and dusts everything, I'd pay an order of magnitude more for that. Just saying.",否,5,Rachel Neumeier,2023-09-20

My concern was always that it would suck up cat toys and random objects and become irreversibly jammed. This has not been the case. When an object gets stuck in the roller, it makes a loud beep and shuts off if it’s not corrected. This thing has sucked up cat toy wands with long strings, gloves, paper towels, underwear, shoelaces. I often find it in a corner of my home, jammed and dead. But I’ve been very pleased with how easy it is to un-jam it and how well it still works. It neither breaks itself nor the cat toys when I have to unwind them. It still works great.

For normal cleanup Eufy can't be beat. I have been surprised over and over again how this little unit picks up so much and how smart it is. I just pick up anything I don't want vacuumed, block off any low overhangs that Eufy might get stuck under and put on the room setting for a half hour. When i come back Eufy managed to do the whole room. I especially love that Eufy will get under sofas and tables and goes places my upright can't and does a decent job. When I have a special area that needs doing the spiral setting is a hit and works a like a charm. I liked it so much right away that I bought one for my cousin whose wife likes to do everything the hard way. Now he runs it while she is out and she doesn't have to vacuum nearly as much any more.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2D64LTO34B5HK,Not the same vacuum as before,Color:Black,"My wife and I never realized that we needed a RoboVac until our daughter showed us her Eufy 11s. Even though she manually vacuums regularly, she supplements her floor cleaning with the 11s and it picks up even more dust and dirt from the floors and carpet. She explained to us that this vacuum received high marks from many review sources such as Consumer Reports in the basic category. Since neither one of us needed or wanted all of the advanced features of the other models or brands, this model was perfect for our needs.
<br>
<br>We ordered one with her help to assure ourselves that we were getting the EXACT RoboVac that she has been very satisfied with. Our purchase was only two weeks after she purchased hers.
<br>
<br>We used our new vacuum for a month in our home with good results before we discovered that her 11s has TWO side brushes and our 11s has only ONE!
<br>
<br>We decided to get both of our vacuums together and release them in the same room at the same time to see if there was any performance difference. As expected, her vacuum with the two side brushes gathered more debris with one battery charge than ours did with only the one side brush. We did this in several rooms with the same results.
<br>
<br>Since our Amazon return window had closed, I wrote to Eufy about being unhappy about the switch in design and backed it up with our performance findings. I explained that the photos and videos on Amazon clearly showed two side brushes on this model and I did not get what they represented or what I expected and paid for.
<br>
<br>This is the first response that I received.
<br>
<br>********
<br>Thank you for contacting eufy customer support. Sorry to learn about the issue with your RoboVac!
<br>
<br>Can you please tell us the information first?
<br>- A pdf copy or screenshot of the invoice of your purchase (or a picture of the receipt if you bought it from the store)
<br>- your current address.
<br>- The serial number of the product, normally located on the product itself or on the product package (example: ABC0123456789XXX) or a photo of the product (if no serial number can be found).
<br>
<br>After our tests, we found that by adjusting the speed of the side brush, we found that only one side brush can also guarantee the cleaning performance. Based on this, reducing one side brush can reduce the customer's consumable usage and maintenance costs.
<br>
<br>I am sorry that we did not revise the information on the purchase page and manual in time. If you did buy it from our official store, we would like to give you a new set of side brushes.
<br>
<br>********
<br>Seriously? One brush can clean better than two just by adjusting the speed? What about the fact that with two brushes working, each pass of the vacuum will cover the width of the 11s, but with one brush working, only half of the 11s width is cleaning? This means that it will take two passes of the one brush vacuum to equal a single pass of the two brush model. If the battery sizes are equal, that means that only half as much debris is cleaned per battery charge.
<br>
<br>I am not agreeing with Eufy’s attempt at justification. In my mind this was done as a cost-cutting move disguised as trying to save the customer’s cost of consumables and maintenance.
<br>
<br>Since I was not satisfied with the answer that was given, there was a link at the end of the email to escalate the issue with Eufy. I again explained the situation in detail and the following reply was received.
<br>
<br>********
<br>Thank you for informing us about the inconvenience so we are made aware of your concern. This is Shane, the customer service manager who will take care of your case.
<br>
<br>We understand that you've noticed a difference in cleaning performance between your RoboVac model (with one side brush) and your daughter's model (with two side brushes). We want to assure you that we take your concerns seriously and are here to help.
<br>
<br>In our continuous efforts to improve our products, we have recently made some changes to our RoboVac models that features only one side brush. This decision was made after extensive testing which showed that by adjusting the speed and motion of the single side brush, we can achieve the same, if not better, cleaning performance as models with two side brushes.
<br>
<br>We understand that this change may have caused some confusion and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. As a token of our appreciation for your understanding and patience, we would like to offer you a Replacement Kit for your RoboVac if you decide to keep your current model.
<br>
<br>********
<br>They still maintain that the performance is equal or better with the design change. I asked repeatedly how I could obtain the two brush version of the 11s that our daughter has but that request was not addressed and ignored. The “Replacement Kit” that they offered was just spare filters, brushes, and a roller, not a two brush replacement model, so I gave up.
<br>
<br>I am here to let future buyers know that this is NOT the same vacuum that all of the older reviews tested and Eufy quietly change the design only for their benefit. The vacuum works fine, but knowing that it performed better in the original version has left me unsatisfied.
<br>
<br>As a final comment, it is interesting that Eufy’s higher end vacuums still maintain the two brush system and some even add two vacuum fans. So if the one brush system works so well on the low end model, why isn’t it implemented on the high-end models?",是,2,Callie T,2023-08-27

US,B07R295MLS,R2S4DZ52WZBG2K,Mixed review...,,"I bought this based on a lot of positive reviews. In case the reviews are for several models, I bought a thin model. It worked great initially. Then it kept getting stuck under a chair. I bought some magnetic tape (eufy-approved) to try and keep the thing from getting stuck, but no luck. After about a month, the suction stopped working. Here's where I tell you the good parts: the customer service was actually pretty great. They actually responded and gave me things to try. In the end, they sent videos if I was willing to try and replace a component (too complicated for me) and ultimately offered to replace the unit if I would mail it in but I was moving in short order, so that really wasn't an option. I do have friends who love theirs. During the time that it worked, I was pleased with the amount of golden-retriever dog hair it picked up on a daily basis. I would probably consider purchasing from them again based on the customer service experience alone. In short: customer service A+++; execution: B-",是,4,Kelley C. Gonzales,2023-08-19

<br>
<br>Con: doesn't spot clean well. Can't figure out how to direct it to focus on the spot (usually where I spilled because I let the tray get too full). If your spot is within 1' of a wall or furniture, the direction buttons get over-ridden by the avoidance software.
<br>
<br>I owned the previous model, if finally died (3-4 years of use!). I was concerned about the one side brush, but it works even better than the last one. I travel with my dog for my job, it works great on low to medium pile carpet and floors of all kinds (hotel &amp; Airbnb living). The new filter is washable (I haven't yet), and it picks up better than my daughters apartment vacuum (not an expensive one). It also handles more of my very long hair. I only clean the brush once a week, empty the bin every 3-4 days. It can't be programmed to avoid an area, but look at the price. I purchased some cheap wooden dowels that I place around spots I want it to avoid (as I travel it isn't practical to mount cords on the wall, etc.)

The second Eufy, that was supposed to be exactly the same as the first because I bought the same exact one, 1) only has 1 brush, but 2) Keeps Falling off the step! It doesn’t seem to have the same amount of drop sensors as it’s older version. Today, the first one sounds like it’s dying a slow death as the motor is making a tired hum.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3JDCEVJIUZ91C,Not as handy as I’d hoped…,Color:Black,"This is my first purchase of any kind of robot vacuum, so I can’t provide any comparisons with others. Keep this in mind as you read my review.
<br>I thought this vacuum would help me reduce the amount of time I spend on house chores by doing the vacuuming for me, but I have discovered that it is no less work just running my traditional electric vacuum, which does a better job of picking up dust, pet hair, and crumbs than this vacuum does.
<br>This vacuum has an automatic, timed daily schedule of 30 minutes in duration. You set the time you want the vacuum to clean, and each day it will start at that time. However, it will clean random strips of floor in an unpredictable manner. The other functions are ones you have to control with the provided remote - and they have their own issues as well - but I will just focus on the timed/scheduled function, because that’s why I bought this vacuum…to do it for me.
<br>Does it, though? Not really.
<br>With the scheduled cleaning, it moves at random. The best way I can describe it is if the vacuum was a pinball and your room was a pinball machine. If it bumps into a barrier, it will perform either a 120 degree or 240 degree rotation, and then move forward until it hits another barrier, then repeats the same rotation and goes off in yet another direction. This means it can get stuck in smaller rooms more easily, covering the same area repeatedly until the cleaning cycle ends.
<br>For example, I have my vacuum set up in the living room, where there is ample wood floor to cover. There is a small guest bathroom just off the living room. The vacuum starts up precisely at the timed setting each day, and makes perhaps 2-3 passes in the living room, cleaning in a strip about 4” wide, but inevitably ends up in the little bathroom for the majority of the 30 minute cleaning cycle as it blindly bumps its way around, seemingly trapped in an endless sequence of bumps and turns, unable to rotate out of the doorway of the bathroom and back to the living room. I often just have to take control over the vacuum and guide it out of the doorway, but if I have to be there watching the vacuum, then I can’t run this setting while I’m not home.
<br>It would probably be okay for placing in one small room like a bedroom, but the docking station has to be out in an open space. So, you’d have to carry the vacuum or remotely move it off the dock to the desired room, turn it on, and shut the door on the way out. But the vacuum probably wont shut off on its own this way…
<br>Another issue is with the end of the timed cleaning cycle. My vacuum usually does not find its docking station and turn off after 30 minutes. It will keep on cleaning until I turn it off or move it close to the dock. I have the docking station set up in an open area where there is nothing within 6 feet of it on either side, and 12 feet on the front. However, if the vacuum is outside of the range of the dock, it won’t find it and it will just keep cleaning (I suppose until it runs out of battery if you don’t intervene). I take over control with the remote and maneuver it back towards the dock. Once it gets close, it will link up and dock itself.
<br>Certain obstacles can be an amusing and/or frustrating nightmare. Pet food dishes, charging cords, and plastic bags have to be removed from any area the vacuum could end up. This may seem to be a no-brainer, but if you don’t survey the area and remove potential hazards first, you might wind up with a disaster. The vacuum will get caught in any cords or loose plastic baggies on the floor. It once yanked my partner’s phone charger from the wall and dragged it across the room and under the bed. We spent a half hour searching for his missing charger, wondering who took it and didn’t put it back, only to discover that the vacuum stole it!
<br>It will climb onto my pet food mat and proceed to wreak havoc with the food dishes, throwing food here and there as it pushes the bowls around, vacuuming up bits of kibble, and getting stuck on the larger pieces of kibble. Here I thought I bought a cleaning machine, and instead I got a tiny tornado terror. Sometimes it’s a mess to clean up after my robot!
<br>Finally, this vacuum is really loud. I sure wish I didn’t have to babysit it and could run it while I’m not home, but I can’t trust this thing to run without a hitch.
<br>On the bright side, I’m impressed that it does start at the right time every day. I like that it docks itself on the charging dock (if it can find it). I am also impressed that it does not fall down the staircase when it reaches the top stair, as advertised. The bumper also does not cause any damage to my walls or furniture.
<br>So, they got some things right with this vacuum. Would I recommend it, though? Nah. Not unless you have a good sense of humor and money to blow.",是,2,Svizzera,2023-08-17

This robot is more reliable than anyone I have hired to fix things in the house haha. I was skeptical. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna spend more time chasing around a vacuum getting stuck everywhere but haven’t had to at all. It surprised me when it fit under all my furniture which was also an added bonus. It also heads right back to the charger and doesn’t get lost. Yay!!!!!,是,5,Kay,2023-08-01

US,B07R295MLS,R3AR0H10OX9SWD,You get what you pay for,,"I bought this being well aware this model was basic as in no mapping, no phone connectivity, etc. So, the performance reflects it. It vacuums ok but man it just goes around our house like a stumbling drunk looking for his/her car. I have to block the cased openings (not completely open concept) so it will stay in one area long enough to do a decent job. It also GETS STUCK under the toe kick area of our kitchen cabinets, refrigerator and sometimes the dishwasher edge. Very aggravating. BUT it was a deal of the day and only paid $150.00 for it so... I will say it does a good job with our constantly shedding labrador retriever on our hardwood and tile. So, I’m keeping it for that reason alone. The bedrooms are blocked off from the dog. It does a superficial job on carpet anyway. I’ve started closing the bedroom doors as to not waste its “energy” in them. FYI, the area I “allow” it to cover is around 1500 sf. Close bathroom doors, too.",否,3,Suky Girl,2023-07-30

I’m constantly having to stop what I’m doing to clean the sensors and figure out why it stopped. I could physically vacuum the house in less time than it takes for the Eufy to vacuum.

You do need to make sure you clean it out, but dumping the dust cup and cleaning the filter between uses takes less than one minute. You can also buy the replacement parts as needed.

<br>The compact design of the vacuum cleaner makes it easy to maneuver and store, and it has become an indispensable tool in my daily cleaning routine. It effortlessly reaches tight spaces and corners, ensuring no dust or debris is left behind.
<br>
<br>Moreover, the durability of this vacuum cleaner is noteworthy. Despite the regular use, it has shown no signs of wear and tear, demonstrating its exceptional sturdiness and build quality.

You can sweep and then run it and it will still come up with stuff. You can run the Dyson and it will still come up with stuff. It's more reliable than most people (jk, but am I, really?).

US,B079QYYGF1,RE468AB93RUN8,"""Eufy: A Disastrous Dance of Debris, Disappointment, and Despair""",Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;Eufy, oh Eufy, where do I even begin with this so-called ""robotic vacuum""? From the moment I laid eyes on it, I knew it was destined to be a disappointment. Its sleek design may be visually appealing, but it's nothing more than a facade to mask its utter lack of cleaning prowess.
<br>
<br>Let's talk about its ""intelligence"" – or rather, the lack thereof. Eufy seems to have a knack for getting stuck on the simplest obstacles, like a lost child in a maze. Oh, there's a chair leg? Better stop dead in its tracks and beep for help. And don't even get me started on its so-called mapping capabilities. It's as if Eufy is navigating blindfolded, randomly bumping into walls and furniture, leaving swathes of untouched dirt in its wake.
<br>
<br>The promises of efficient cleaning and time-saving convenience fall flat on their face. It takes Eufy an eternity to cover even a modestly-sized room, all the while leaving behind visible dirt and debris. It's supposed to be a ""hands-free"" solution, but in reality, you'll find yourself constantly rescuing it from its own misadventures.
<br>
<br>The quality of its cleaning is equally underwhelming. Rather than effectively lifting and sucking up dirt, Eufy seems to do little more than push it around, leaving behind a messy trail like a toddler playing with a broom. And let's not forget the incredibly loud noise it emits, turning any cleaning session into an auditory assault.
<br>
<br>Oh, and did I mention the notorious issue of Eufy getting tangled up in cords and pet hair? It's as if it has a magnetic attraction to anything that could disrupt its feeble attempts at cleaning.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Eufy is a perfect example of style over substance. It may look like a high-tech marvel, but its performance is nothing short of laughable. Save your hard-earned money and invest in a reliable, capable robotic vacuum from a reputable brand. Eufy is a frustrating, ineffective waste of space that falls short of even the most basic expectations.",是,3,MsBeautiFUL,2023-07-22

US,B07R295MLS,RIUU4080NLLZ0,He's like a curious puppy,,"I'm going to start by saying that our home is fairly tortuous for a robot vacuum. We have multiple shedding dogs, an older house that leaks air, we're in a dusty part of the country, and our house has been added onto several times and has some varying floor heights betwixt rooms. Overall, this little guy does a good job. He's full of dust and hair every time we empty him. He does have issues getting up some of the small steps, but I don't hold that against him.
<br>
<br>You can schedule when he will run and he'll stick to it - unless he dies somewhere. If he gets lost and can't find home and dies, his internal clock seems to reset and he'll suddenly run at 8pm instead 10am like you set.
<br>
<br>He doesn't do very well on carpets and rugs. He's great on hardwood and tile. He's the perfect height to get wedged under our cabinets.
<br>
<br>With the amount of dog hair we have, after about 6 months various things will get filled with hair. Some of those are easy to clean, some require parts replacement.
<br>
<br>We had to send our first guy back because the roller brush kept complaining. The second one, I tore apart before calling in and had determined that hair had gotten into a sealed area and gummed it up. When I called in, they asked if I was comfortable opening him up and replacing parts. They sent me the parts and I got him running again. After he goes out of warranty, it looks like he'll cost me about $25 to fix each time.
<br>
<br>So, I'm impress with him overall. He does his job. Sometimes he's like a curious puppy and will insist on going someplace you don't want him to go. He does a good job of cleaning up the dog hair and dirt.",否,4,GreenEgg,2023-07-13

But unless the bot gets lost, I run the robot manually. All of the robot vacs cannot pick up large debris. They will try to eat bags and cords and they can be hard on carpet fringes. I still have to move the larger stuff off the floor and pick up the throw rugs, so running this on a regular basis with a timer does not always work out. I have since found out the other bots that are wifi connected can also work in manual mode, but have specific wifi requirements. I don't have a wifi router. The other difference in this model from the previous one is that it has only one sweep. My older robots all had two sweeps. I like it better with two sweeps. The robot's low design can get under places I otherwise can reach without moving the furniture. There are a couple of places where the robot still gets stuck and I have to rescue it.

<br>I owned a previous version of this Eufy vacuum, and there was this annoying issue of how out of 2200sq ft it would just keep going to the same 1x1 sq ft and hump an inclined leg for a small table until the battery ran out.
<br>This version doesnt seem to get stuck on inclined stool/table legs like the previous version. Plus its safe to use this on the second floor as it will detect when the stairs start.

It comes with a remote, fits under all of my couches, has cut down on my needing to sweep multiple times a day and I would buy 5 more if needed for floor space because I am obsessed with it.

<br>We used to have a black lab who shedded A LOT, but I think her hair would have meant constant emptying and it would have been too much, but it does fine with our non shedding poodle.

It runs around my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and back bedroom with no particular path but just runs around vacuuming area rugs, tile floor and laminate floor with area rugs. Chases my Labrador from time to time, but she's use to it now after second run. Even put one of her favorite toys on top of it and she pranced around and grabbed it off. It collects quite a bit of dog hair for it's small dust pan..just packs it in. Very quiet....you do have to pick up rugs with tassels that's about the only issue I have had so far.

I will note that the new one only has 1 brush on the front and not 2 like the old and as the pictures show. I was a bit disappointed with that change but it seems to it seems to be doing okay.

That wasn't a huge deal, still seemed to function properly. However recently it's sweeping power has seemed to decrease drastically. In order to fully clean a space it needs to go over the same spot 3-4 times. We have a very small living &amp; dining area of only couple hundred sq ft &amp; it takes the whole battery life to completely clean the whole thing; which used to take only a half hour working top notch.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1KR76V2RVECVR," I know I'm giving this vacuum cleaner four stars, but honestly, I love it",Color:Black,"I've been using this vacuum cleaner for about two months. Here's what I think are important details:
<br>
<br>--It's great! I was surprised by how well it pulled pet hair off the carpets. Did I mention I have six dogs? I have six dogs. I LOVED how well this vacuum cleaner performed.
<br>--However, its performance on carpet did decline over the two months. Then it started making a very loud noise while running, especially on hard surfaces; I contacted the company; after a bit of going back and forth, they sent me a replacer roller brush. Boom, instant solution for the noise AND the performance on the carpet is back to where it was to begin with. I hope there are roller brushes I can buy separately, because I would be happy to replace the brush every two months to keep the performance high.
<br>
<br>--It's quiet, except see above, there was this temporary problem with the roller brush. But ordinarily it's quiet!
<br>
<br>--It's easy to clean all the parts, but you should take your time to figure out how to take out the filters and take everything apart. The filter compartment opens from the top AND the dust container opens at the side. I didn't see how to take out the filters at first. The filters are really good because this machine picks up tons of dust. There's a gravel road by my house, so wow is there a lot of dust. This vacuum cleaner gets all that off the floor. I'm dying for a flying version that dusts horizontal surfaces all over the house.
<br>
<br>--The little tool that comes with the vacuum cleaner has a tiny little razor blade, very useful for cleaning the pet hair off the roller. I didn't realize that at once either so I was using a little scissors, but it's a great tool once you realize there's a razor blade attached to it. I personally found it necessary to clean the roller brush twice during a cleaning period at first. That thing really picks up pet hair. After the first week, I could just clean the pet hair off the roller brush before each use and that was enough.
<br>
<br>--The vacuum cleaner does go back to its charger almost all the time. Every now and then it will almost make it, but not quite. This is no problem since I just put the vacuum cleaner on the charger the next time I walk down that hallway. The charger power cord is very thin. I have the charger downstairs, where the dogs aren't allowed without supervision, because puppy teeth would clip through a cord that thin in jig time. It's no problem at all to bring the vacuum cleaner upstairs every day and then take it down again. It's very light and easy to carry.
<br>
<br>Overall, I love this vacuum cleaner. Love it! I definitely think you should try it if you're hesitating to buy a really expensive model. Very much worth the price.",是,4,Rachel Neumeier,2023-06-30

Easy enough, I pulled out that hair. Now it’s working great going around the whole house. I’m impressed and happy so far.

No bells and whistles - it comes with a remote, but cannot be controlled with your phone. You can, however, set a schedule with the remote. It's a bit thinner than my previous vacuums so it gets stuck in places the others didn't. This is a postivie and a negative, because it is cleaning where my other unit wasn't but then gets trapped.

Ultimately, what I end up with after 2 hrs are little piles of hair all over my floor. So, I have to go around and pick those up.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2ZKMEUYH433DO, Only 1 brush on newest model but being sold as if it's the old (better) model,Color:Black,"I purchased one of these three weeks ago and love it. Went back to get a second one (for second floor) but discovered that the very newest model only has 1 cleaning brush. Tried it and the newer one picks up less cat fur and debris/dust and it takes a longer time to do so. The manufacturer told me that the reason they removed the 2nd brush was for customer savings and convenience. Not true! You need the cleaning action of the second brush, and yes, if you have hair/fur or dust/dirt, you will have to occasionally clean the brushes (pull off debris). It's easy to do this, and the vacuum comes with a snap on replacement brush. Also, the manufactor gave me a story about ""using R&amp;D"" to make the new (single brush) work better/go faster. Not true - the single brush works no differently from the brushes on the older model. You just get one less cleaning brush on this newer model. This was not mentioned on Amazon. I will buy a third one now and hope to get the slighter older model I bought three weeks ago (they are all labeled and marketed under the same model number). And return the single brush one(s). It's wrong to make a major change to the model, then call it the same model number, then give a b s ""r&amp;d"" explanation to the customer.

US,B07R295MLS,R3U4UWLTWTGKV8,"Love-Hate relationship with Eufy, but own 3",Color:Black,"Generally, we love the Eufy Robt Vacuum cleaners. But for some odd reason Eufry decided to limit their Boundary Strip technology to only a few models. Unfortunately, the 11S &amp; 11S Max are Not equipped with 'barrier' sensor technology, as with many of their models. 1st, we like the Eufy vacuums because they are quieter than other brands we tried. We tried RoboVac, Shark, etc. and all were louder. 2nd, the 11S and several models with a higher ""suction"" rating, in practice, do a better job of picking up and cleaning than the other manufacturers robo vacuums we've tried.
<br>Our main complaint with Eufy is that the models without Boundary Strip technology get stuck. The only 'suggestion(s)' we've received are to a) Place 'mechanical' barriers like boxes which have to be set out before vacuuming and then picked up. b) Buy a model with less suction power that has Boundary Strip Technology or c) Buy one of the few Vacuum &amp; Mop models that has both High Suction and Boundary Strip Technology, but you are forced to use ""an App"". to control.
<br>We have enough 'junk' on our phones. We'd have to open the App etc. What we love about the 11S &amp; 11S Max is the cleaning quality and simplicity of use. Press 1 button and away it goes! After that, we empty the bin, wipe it off and put it back, waiting for the next use. No muss or fuss and no worries that a 'power hit' has taken out the Wi-Fi for a few seconds so we have to ""reset"" something else along with our Alexas and 22 connected devices! [2 days ago, we had a 40 second power failure that took me an hour to reset the Hub and all the lights, plugs, &amp; 'devices'.]
<br>We really like the quality, cleaning capabilities and simplicity of our Eufy(s). We don't like having to put out barracks and then pick them up every time we vacuum. We would 'love it' if Eufy would make a 2,000 pa (or greater) suction robo vacuum with their simple but very efficient &amp; effective remote, that has Boundary Strip technology.

New one purchased in February 2022- by June 2023 it has no suction. I made sure it is cleaned, wiped down etc. When I reached out to EUFY customer support they told me all the things to check. Which I did again. No success in improving suction. They said since it had been 16 months since purchase they could not help me. I think a vacuum should last longer than 16 months. I will go with a different brand next time. $250 is a lot to pay every year for a vacuum.

<br>TIPS: always set it on max suction/power and empty the canister and clean the filter after EACH use. ALSO, trim loose threads from mats or rugs. They can get caught up in it.

I had scheduled the vacuum to run automatically every day for about 2 weeks which is probably overkill.

You can get to that filter from the other side so I'll just have to clean it as best I can.

US,B079QYYGF1,R11SQJA3U4F987,I'm very happy with my eufy!,Color:Black,"I was searching for a lower cost, easy to use robo vac. I originally tried a brand that tied itself into Alex, and I did buy Alexa and something else, but returned the alexa, sweeper and the echo dot THe sweeper didn't work out for me because of my internet connection being weak (AT&amp;T) and I REALLY hated the idea that echo dot and alexa were able to listen to us 24/7. SO I shipped all three back to amazon and bought the DUMB eufy. I' glad that I did! Eufy cleans very well, does have the ability to timer start and stop, , and I love it. Just the amount of ""stuff"" that is in his bottom after every cleaning assures me that Eufinater is in the building! I do wish that he would scrub the floors, but thats going to be on my next model, or I may just buy a seperate machine for that.

<br>My part comment is a tip for those who may be interested. We live in a nice ranch, with one central hallway front to back (north to south) for the doors. The other runs through the private bedroom side of the house, east to west and meeting at the central hallway.
<br>
<br>I often times only want to do the bedroom side or the living, kitchen side. Eufy is pretty talented at not running into things, so I put a couple bath towels at the entrance of where ever I DON""T want him to go and then he only cleans where I want it done. Easy peasy!

<br>In the last six mths I also purchased an IRobot Roomba I6+. Robot with self emptying bin. I must say. It cost 1/3 more than the Eufy, and is a lower level in the Roomba series. My goal was to reduce the actual cleaning of the equipment. I run these machines at least every other day through out the entire house. (Each does 1/2 the house). The Roomba is efficient and cleans but the bin emptying process is just not functioning properly ni have to empty the bin and clean the rollers, etc more often than not. Also constantly cleaning sensors which I don’t have to do with the Eufy. It gets stuck more often. All in all it takes up too much of my time, but I can’t toss it. Cost too much.

We have two cats, 4 humans, hardwood floors, area rugs with fringed edges, and Turtle takes care of all of those with ease, grace, and no complaints. Seriously, Turtle is the best! I have two friends who have bought the same model (also with multiple pets and area rugs) - and they cannot stop singing this vacuum’s praises! I brush the filter when I clear out the dirt container daily, and wash the filter once a week as instructed. No complaints, mishaps or malfunctions in 6 months (knock well vacuumed, dust free wood). On occasion (once a week?), Turtle finds a cord or something that causes her to send out “help me” beeps and then shut off until I can come rescue her. Not a big deal at all!

US,B07R295MLS,R386Q0OP19I49H,New update has ONE brush not two,Color:Black,"We bought the Shark AI vac with a self empty base but unfortunately they have designed the software such that it can only connect to a dedicated 2.4ghz network. The robot cannot connect to dual band WiFi routers that choose 2.4 or 5ghz automatically. It was amazing at cleaning but we can’t use most of the features without WiFi so we decided to return it.
<br>
<br>I decided to just play it safe and get this remote control robot. One of the key reasons we chose the Eufy over other brands was the two brushes. The Shark did a great job sweeping everything on both sides to the middle and sucking it up. All the other pictures and videos I’ve seen of the Eufy 11S Max show two brushes, so I was really disappointed to see this now only has one.
<br>
<br>Aside from the single brush, the very random cleaning pattern seems pretty silly. It just wanders around and seems to choose totally random directions, so it can canvas the whole house several times and still miss areas. The robots that methodically clean line by line do a much better job.
<br>
<br>I do like how quiet it is and how much lower profile it is, allowing it to get under the couch.

<br>We’re going to give it a few more days and see how it does before making a decision to return. If it does great I’ll upgrade my review. I have a lot of nice Anker products so I’m hoping the loss of a brush and totally random cleaning pattern end up a non-issue.",否,3,ArmyStrongMD,2023-05-25

The results were alright but as I’ve unfortunately learned with many vacuums over the years, for best results put it on full power (I miss the old Kirby vacuum cleaners)
<br>
<br>I haven’t used the scheduled cleaning feature because I rather be present and observe what it’s doing and step in if I need to. For example, it gets stuck trying to get underneath my fridge which gets narrower to the floor. The same happens with an old dresser I have. Admittedly these two are my biggest pains when it comes to cleaning underneath them, so I don’t hold it against the vacuum. It’s great for cleaning corners and other spots that usually require getting on the floor myself or moving furniture in order to clean them.
<br>
<br>This isn’t going to replace your standard vacuum though. It just helps lighten the load for deep cleaning days. It doesn’t have any issue getting back to its base when it’s quitting time.

The second problem that could happen to some people is the robot shut the door on itself and getting stuck there. You will have to remember to close all the door or keep it open all the way. Overall I love the product it really help with cleaning. Maintenance is dead simple.,是,5,Tynguyen,2023-05-19

I was tired of the Roomba getting caught under my coffee table. However, the Eufy does get caught on other things that the Roomba didn't.

The dust/rubbish compartment is fairly small, so there’s only so much it can do, but it definitely makes a difference. In a house with five pets, it makes the amount of loose hair and litter quite a bit more manageable. It runs for quite a long time on each charge.
<br>My main complaint is it is quite bad with thresholds and over time seems to get worse as the brushes start to wear. I would like to run it while I’m out of the house, but it wouldn’t be possible; it would end up stuck in a doorway for two hours.

It’s very basic, and has no smarts, so you really have to be aware of where it can get stuck and where it could get cords sucked up into it and such. As long as you’re aware of its limitations, it does a great job. I would not recommend starting it and ignoring it, at least at first. It does a great job of getting up dirt and runs for nearly 1.5 hours on hard flooring. Our downstairs is ~900 sq ft and it cleans it all on one charge without issue.

US,B079QYYGF1,R30EM53SLPKFCP,So far I’m impressed,Color:Black,"My stick vacuum died as I was finishing vacuuming my 2br condo. I came across a consumer report ranking this #1 for robots under $300. I clicked on Amazon and it arrived the next day. Set up and charging was quick and easy. I was a little annoyed watching this thing go around for what felt like forever, in a seemingly very inefficient manner. I could have vacuumed my entire place in a few minutes. However, when I saw how much it picked up when I had vacuumed the day before, it made me feel very grossed out with how inefficient my dying vacuum had been. Additionally, my condo looked cleaner, almost as if I had washed the floors. I still wasn’t sure about it as I felt like I was still going to want another vacuum in my life for just quick areas. The next day I closed it off in my bedroom (that I didn’t let it go in the day before). I had two smaller pile shag rugs that I thought I was going to have to toss because I couldn’t get them clean and this thing completely spruced them up! I think to was able to get into places under my bed that I couldn’t with my stick. Again, I was super grossed out by how much it picked up but now I’m sold on this thing. I also tried out the “spot” setting in my bathroom and I could maybe see doing that vs pulling out a stick vacuum.
<br>It managed transitioning well in pretty much all areas of my condo. The only issue is the half inch high marble slab by my fireplace- I just think it will be safer for the robot’s life if I corner that off once I get to the stage of letting it go when I’m not home. Baby steps in releasing the power but I think once I can let it go while I’m not home I’ll be even happier with it.

But, still had the problem with not reaching under the cabinets. Then I got a Eufy! I won't ever buy another brand. My main loves for this Robovac is that it doesn't have to be trained to find its way back to the base-the smartest one over all! Eufy gets under the cabinets. And when it's time to clean it out - you don't need any tools to remove parts, they just snap in and out!!! So easy.

It has minimal but up-to-standard features that go slightly above what’s expected at this price. I live in a one bedroom ~550sq FT apartment with an L shaped layout. It’s a rectangular open livingroom/kitchen with a door to to the bedroom in the corner. The 11S handles just about every inch of the floor with minimal intervention and I only have to empty out it’s container every few days. I like the ability to manually adjust the suction strength, but BoostIQ does a good job of automatically increasing that on carpet and decreasing it on hardwood. Any type of scheduling is better than none, but I’d prefer a weekly schedule that can be customized per day instead of just what time each day. Overall happy with the purchase but I could see myself upgrading to something else with nicer features down the road.
<br>Some quick notes:
<br>
<br>-It absolutely WILL clean multiple rooms with no problems. Make sure you leave the doors wide open with plenty of space around the entryway.
<br>-It can easily get tangled in cords on the ground or get caught on the corner of small rugs. I move my bath mat off the floor every night so it doesn’t trap itself when it runs in the morning
<br>-It tries to find the charging base for about 3-5 minutes before it powers off. Put the base in the “hot spot” of your home where the vacuum is most likely to frequently pass by.
<br>-For me, it successfully docks itself about 9/10 times with no issues. You can purchase additional bases for $40 directly from Eufy and set them up in multiple rooms so it always finds home.

No app, just a simple remote to schedule a cleaning time. That being said, I am SHOCKED with how well it cleans the house. It covers all of our rooms on the first floor and even gets into a lot of low/tight areas that I would normally have trouble vacuuming without moving furniture! It always makes it’s way home and I’ve only had it get stuck once so far (the lip between our hallway floor and bathroom tile is a little too high for it to make it over reliably). We have a dog and 2 cats and it cleans the entire first floor of our house more than adequately without any room mapping, etc. The one caveat is that i do have to use the included cutting tool to untangle hair from the roller about once a week (not a deal breaker by any means, it takes less than 5 minutes).

<br>
<br>PROS: It’s pretty quiet.
<br>It helps maintain clean floors in between using my hand-held Shark vacuum.
<br>Does great at rolling from hardwoods into our carpeted bedrooms.
<br>Gets stuck seldomly.
<br>
<br>Cons: Takes several hours to fully charge.
<br>Bumps into EVERYTHING despite having sensors.
<br>Doesn’t clean the nooks and crannies like a typical vacuum.
<br>Takes a long time to find home base.
<br>I’m extra mad at it today because it ATE my cat’s food! Literally rolled right onto the plate and devoured it. I spent hours trying to get wet puréed salmon out of the crevices. Again, I thought this had sensors to prevent that kind of thing?!
<br>The capsule that stores all the dirt and fur is very small, so I find myself babysitting the vacuum (which we named Vic the Vac) so as to empty it about every half hour.
<br>Vic loves to eat wires.
<br>According to the manual, parts must be replaced pretty often to keep it in tiptop condition.

I have a combination of hardwood and short pile carpet and it does well on both. I also have some area rugs with a fringe border that is sometimes a problem getting caught in the brush.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1U6AY52E0HYN8,"Good, but maybe not for long haired shedding pets",Color:Black,"I recently moved from a mostly carpeted apartment to a home with all hardwood/tiled floor. Until now, I never realized how bad my dog’s shedding was. It’s suddenly all over everything. Before where the carpet would grab onto any loose hairs, it’s taking over furniture and our clothes and just about everything else in the house. I used to get by vacuuming, well, maybe not as often as I should honestly, but in the first few days of living here it became clear that I wouldn’t be able to get away with that, but I simply couldn’t keep up. I quickly purchased one of the first affordable robot vacuums I saw. Here’s what you should know if you also have a dog with long, thick fur…
<br>
<br>- way more hair gets wrapped around the brush than actually gets picked up and sucked into the canister. I have to clean the brush every time before I turn it on. I can’t just turn it on and walk away. The design does make it super easy to clean though and it includes a nifty little tool with a blade that breaks up the hair, but it’s annoying to have to do every time I need to vacuum. If I don’t do this, it will stop running and tell me the brush is stuck and needs to be cleaned. This kind of makes the automatic scheduling useless to me since I have to “prepare” the vacuum first every time
<br>
<br>- biggest drawback for me is the random little deposits of fur it likes to leave around on the floor. See the attached picture. Even with daily cleaning of the brush like I mentioned above… it will be running and be fine for several minutes but then it seems to not be able to grab onto all the hair (BECAUSE IT ALL GETS STUCK IN THE BRUSH and then there’s too much buildup) so once there’s a buildup of too much hair that won’t wrap around the brush, it’s just like “I’ve had enough” I guess, and then lets go of all the excess hair
<br>
<br>I wonder if all this would still happen no matter the vacuum I got. My girl sheds religiously, I’d be surprised if there IS a vacuum that can keep up. But I thought I’d still make a review about it because I don’t remember seeing one like this when I purchased.
<br>
<br>If it weren’t for all my pet fur spawning all over the place, I wouldn’t suspect that there was anything wrong with this little robot. It does do its job really well to clean. It does take a while (like 2 hours for my 1025 square foot home lol) but who cares, it’s vacuuming for you and you get to just sit there.

<br>This little guy picks up EVERYTHING. He picks up my dogs fur, my long hair, and even big pieces of their kibble. He hasn’t gotten jammed yet, and there’s a cleaning brush they included so you can unwrap any hair after you’re done running the vacuum.

We chose the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S MAX: quite a large name for our new, slender robovac! The name eufy sounds feminine to me, and I think of her in feminine terms. I like her: 1) She costs less than half the price of an average veterinary bill, 2) she is quiet yet powerful, and cleans really well 3) she does not get stuck underneath our dishwasher door, 4) she easily docks onto her charger, and 5) she has an extra on/off switch on the side of her “belly”, so our cats cannot trigger her to start working when they run over her. Just like e. e. cummings, she does not believe in capital letters. ❤️",是,5,Maritha,2023-04-22

A couple weeks ago he started having the issue where his roll brush would run and then stop. Eufy support was helpful with troubleshooting, sent a replacement motor, and ensured that the instructions for how to change the motor was included. Now he’s back to cleaning and works just like new!

<br>I didn't go with the wifi version again because I didn't need the wifi portion and even though the wifi version is newer, it doesn't clean noticeably better than this one.

<br>I received the Eufy and immediately liked that the filter was washable and had two outer brushes versus Roombas one brush.
<br>We charged her up and let her go. We were impressed at how quiet and that Eufy worked on all of our surfaces. We have a large home and it went through every room and cleaned each one great.

<br>
<br>A few tricks. First of all it helped to watch her do her thing the first few times. Then we could see what she could handle and what she would get stuck on. Then we began to trust she would be OK in specific areas. Don't leave her alone the first half dozen times.
<br>
<br>The next trick is to think of her as a toddler. Pick up anything that may hurt her or where she will get stuck, like bathroom rugs etc. then rest easy as she does her thing.

<br>The noise is too much for the middle of the night, if in our room, so we put a 2x4 on the floor down the hall so she is blocked and can sweep the other part of the house.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1DC5HIWNUMNLP,OK but not for ultra-clean freaks,Color:Black,"I was looking for an affordable, low-profile robovac to help with maintenance cleaning. I’m a fan of other Anker products, so I had high hopes for this eufy vacuum. Unfortunately, it did not do as great a job as I hoped it would. It would run right over a dusty spot and completely miss some particles directly in its path. Also, sometimes the brushes fling particles to the side and depending on the route, they may or may not get picked up later.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you’re looking for a vacuum for light maintenance, this might be for you. If you’re like me and would rather clean manually to ensure your place is spotless, you might be better off just cleaning manually in the first place.
<br>
<br>On the bright side, it does a great job of finding its “home” — I put it under a side table with only a few inches of clearance on either side and it had no issues returning home. It has a low profile and looks sleek. It’s fairly quiet, definitely quieter than a regular vac.",是,3,M,2023-04-19

The one thing I wish I knew prior to buying it is that when there is a power outage it will leave the docking station and start wandering around aimlessly. At 01:00 hours I can tell you I was terrified trying to figure out what was moving towards my bedroom door. Second complaint is I wish it would tell you when the dust bin was full.

It is handsome and I like the remote control and suction options. However, when it comes to performance, I am disappointed. This eufy get stuck under all low furniture and I had to set up blockades everywhere. Even with items blocking obstacles in place, it keeps trying to wedge itself. Very annoying!!
<br>
<br>This vacuum also loves cords. This unit gets tangled on every single cord and finds cords you didn'trealize you had! My old Roomba never had a problem, but eufy snags every time.
<br>
<br>For cleaning, dog hair does not make it into the dust bin; it all gets wrapped around the brush. This makes emptying the bin cumbersome.
<br>
<br>Finally, the navigation algorithm is terrible. It gets lost under the bed despite the sides being wide open. It is determined to go out of the foot side that is blocked, but it just doesn't get the message to try another way.
<br>
<br>In summary, like everything else in life, you get what you pay for. It was cheaper than everything else, and now I know why.",是,2,Amazon Addict,2023-04-12

US,B079QYYGF1,R35T6L5T1F4AQG,Love it! Bought it twice!,Color:Black,"I bought one for my bf’s place as a gift and we loved it so much I bought it for my own place. It doesn’t really map your floor, so it bounces around based on some internal algorithm, but it works well and it gets everything. It has a long battery life so it can cover my entire floor many times over. The reason I got this one is because at the time it was the most economic, it looks beautiful &amp; sleek, and I love the remote! You can do so much with it. Set timers/schedule, drive it around yourself, put it on a few different settings (like cleaning in a circle in a specific spot, or edge cleaning around the room). It comes with those sweeper things but they easily pull off if stuck under something heavy (mine pulled off under a bed leg that had a gap, for eg), but my old brand did that too, I think it’s a safety thing for them to pop off if they get stuck.
<br>
<br>It finds its way home, but note that if you pick it up, use the remote to guide it, or confuse it by bumping it intentionally to move elsewhere, then it doesn’t dock as easily as if you just never interrupted its flow.
<br>
<br>It docks itself if the battery is about to die though. I’ve never had it run the full time but my bf says it takes about 45 mins to redock itself if you don’t want to call it home.
<br>
<br>Last note, my bf has these chairs with mirror-like bottom bases that ramp up— the robot manual says this, but it can get confused with mirrors. It will go up these and not realize what’s going on so we have to barricade those chairs away. It surprisingly detects/avoids white objects the best.
<br>
<br>I love that I never have to clean my floors but my floor is always clean!!
<br>
<br>PS I do not have any stairs. My bf has thick carpet and it goes over it well.
<br>
<br>PPS It works SUPER well &amp; on carpet you have to clean it out after every 45 min run!! We’re in shock how much dust exists on the floor every day. It fills it up! Carpets are gross!

US,B07R295MLS,R26C1EVS6NJI,"Good introduction to robot vacuums, but after nearly 2 years of regular use, it's losing its power",Color:Black,"It was only after moving from a small studio apartment with carpet to a larger one bedroom apartment with hardwood floors that I realized how much my cat sheds. It was exhausting trying to keep up with the daily vacuuming to keep his fur under control, so I finally broke down and bought this vacuum, not wanting to spend a on of money on something better in case I didn't really care for it. It worked great for a while. Unfortunately, because it's one of the more basic robot vacuums out there, it doesn't memorize the layout of the space, and instead just bounces off walls and other objects, meaning it often misses large spots, or gets stuck under furniture. But it did its job since I was essentially only having it do my kitchen/living area, and the bathroom, since it didn't do too well in the carpeted bedroom. After 2 years of near daily service though, it's coming to the end of its life. It's becoming increasingly finnicky, and the suction is much less powerful. I'll see the vacuum roll over fur and other debris on the ground, and it doesn't suck any of it up. I think I'm ready for an upgrade.",是,3,Junior,2023-04-10

US,B079QYYGF1,R2RVPCC7N3X5DR,Keeps things clean between housekeeper visits,Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;I bought this vacuum about 5 months ago. Therefore, I cannot speak to longevity.
<br>
<br>I intentionally bought a simple vacuum that does not need wifi. there were too many reviews where people had problems with connectivity. In addition, from my research on brands, while Eufy is a good brand, their commitments around privacy did not meet my standards. so if that is important to you, a vacuum like this is great.
<br>
<br>This vacuum takes about 2 hours to clean the main floor of our house, which is at least 2,000 square feet. The first cleaning went off without a hitch, and it's only gotten stuck somewhere (on top of a scale, under the dresser) once. My child who likes video games declared he wanted vacuuming to be his chore, since this has a remote control. However, this really cleans better if you just turn it on and let it go, and he lost interest pretty quickly.
<br>
<br>I use the vacuum once a week and have developed this routine: I empty the dust bin and do any maintenance the day before or a few hours before I want to vacuum. I like to do maintenance before vacuuming since it can be slightly messy. Then I run around and make sure there is nothing on the floor, block behind the recliner (where there are cords) with a foam roller, space out chairs so it can get around them, etc. Set the vacuum off and it is fine on its own.
<br>
<br>I have not had any problem with it returning to the dock. For those who are asking ""do I have to set up the dock as per the instruction manual"", the answer is, yes, if you want it to return to the dock. It picks up the majority of debris and even does well with some chunks. There will be a little debris in harder to reach areas, but as a householder who does not wear shoes at home, this makes the floors bearable in between housekeeper visits. I only use the auto setting and do not use the ""edger"" and do see some areas where there is debris along where the floor meets the wall. if this bothers you, try the ""edger"" setting.
<br>
<br>I just use the auto setting, and usually just push the button on the vacuum and don't even bother with the remote. I run the vacuum once a week and with the size of our house, the dust bin needs to be emptied with every cleaning. As other reviewers have said, read the manual, set it up properly, do the maintenance (which is still less time consuming than vacuuming your whole house) and this should do well for you. It is a small time investment that will save you a lot of time vacuuming in the long run.
<br>
<br>Here is what I like about the vacuum:
<br>-simple set up, no wifi
<br>-hands off, does not get stuck and returns to the dock
<br>-vacuums really well, the floors are clean without me having to do too much work.
<br>-does well with low rugs. Have tucked rug fringe under rug and that works fine.
<br>
<br>Things I dislike:
<br>-when I take the fully charged vacuum off its dock to clean &amp; empty the dust chamber, it then needs 1-2 hours of charging when returned to the dock. So if like me you want to clean it before uses, plan ahead a bit.
<br>-I don't feel like the spot cleaning is worth my time. I have wood and tile floors, and it is faster to get out a broom.
<br>
<br>Overall, this vacuum has solved a big problem: dirty floors in between housekeeping, and I was the only one doing the cleaning. Now it's automated for the most part, I can enjoy clean floors and not spend my time on this chore.",否,5,mountaingoat,2023-03-29

I did not program it or set boundaries or anything. I just turned it on, off it went, and it will return to its base when it runs out of charge. It goes all by itself around the kitchen, down the hall to the bathroom and bedrooms too and it doesn't fall down the stairs either. You can program it to go out at certain time, but I'd rather just manually hit the power button when I know there aren't any charging cords dangling or shoe laces to get caught on.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2S0IQN9DU84GI,Perfect for every day clean!,Color:Black,"For background, The main reason I started looking into an automatic vacuum was for pet hair and litter! I have 3 cats and it's a constant battle to keep the floors clean and the house fresh. In order to keep the floors looking okay, I needed to sweep at least twice per day, but since I hate sweeping I rarely even did it once a day. I started to look into vacuums and this one rated highly on vacuum wars (a YouTube channel I highly recommend if you're doing any kind of vacuum shopping!) and was also in my price range.
<br>
<br>I feel like for the price, I couldn't ask for any better. I work from home, so I don't need any fancy app or anything like that. I also didn't care for Just something fairly quiet and effective that I can run 1-3x per day and will keep the floors clean without actually having to do anything but pick up and press a button lol. I usually run it once in the morning, once before bed, and sometimes once in the afternoon but really only if I feel like it. It does a really good job at picking up litter, cat hair, and crumbs. The house looks, smells, and feels much cleaner! I think it was well worth the price, and replacement parts are affordable if needed down the line.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Fair Price point
<br>- quiet enough that I can run it while my daughter is sleeping, or while I'm working and it's not distracting
<br>- cats don't mind it, they were suspicious at first but accepted it as part of the family within an hour
<br>- good at picking up litter, cat hair, and is able to get in and around most places in my home
<br>- It's easy to empty, I usually do it every day or 2, even though it's not completely full
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Like most of these automatic vacuums, you probably need to do a deep clean once a week or every 2 weeks, using a regular vacuum/ mop. If you didn't it would still be way cleaner than doing nothing at all. For my hard floor, really the mopping is what needs to be done periodically.
<br>-It does get stuck sometimes. Particularly under this one low drawer. Since I only run it when I'm home I just have to go get it if I hear it beeping, not a big deal for my situation.
<br>- The cleaning is randomized so sometimes it misses certain spots or gets one room more thoroughly than another room. You have to be mindful of picking things up and shutting doors where you don't want it to go
<br>- sometimes it disconnects from the charger, I'm not sure if my cats knock it out of place or what, but it can be a bummer if I was planning on running it and it needs to be charged (which takes an hour or 2)
<br>- Sometimes it can find it's way back to the charger, sometimes it dies before it can figure it out. Again, not a huge deal since I'm around, but something to take into account if you plan to run it while you're out.
<br>
<br>Bottom line it's overall not as ""smart"" as the more expensive models, but I feel that's a given. It works perfectly for my situation, and I would buy it again and recommend it for most work at home households",是,5,Maya,2023-03-20

I had low expectations after having a Roomba some years ago that we ended up hating and tossing. This Eufy 11s? Fairly impressed with it. Set it to run once a day - and it'll run for an hour or so at high power. My floors are a lot cleaner and it helps with my allergies by picking up all the dust and cat hair that ends up on my floors and blown around when the HVAC kicks on. Being low in height - it gets under furniture that would be missed with regular vacuuming (especially beds).
<br>
<br>The vacuum itself isn't the coldest beer in the fridge can can be stupid at times. Once in a while it'll get stuck on or under something and not try to rescue itself, or just keep humping whatever it is that it's stuck on like a horny dog and you'll have to go rescue it. But read the instructions. You have to clean the drop sensors once in a while or it'll take a tumble down the stairs. It's well built and survived those falls with barely a scratch. Easy to maintain - just gotta clean it out once in a while (filters and brushes). Has no trouble finding it's charging base when done with it's daily chores.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, it's fairly simple to operate. The remote is fairly straightforward - and a single button on the vacuum itself is all it takes for it to do the job your kids won't do for you.",是,5,Lester A. Wilson,2023-03-18

<br>I love that you can program it to start when you're not at home, and when you return, you have a nicely vacuumed floor!

<br>I am also surprised at the amount of dust the vacuum picks up. It's almost embarrassing how full the waste compartment gets each time he does his run. I really thought it was a relatively clean person, but this vacuum certainly picks up a lot!
<br>
<br>I also like that you can use the remote to steer it around like a remote control toy. You can direct it where its needed, suck up the mess, hit the 'home' button and it puts itself away.
<br>
<br>I have him plugged in and stored under a bench in the bedroom, so its out of sight, and just sort of sneaks out to do its job - then it's tucked away when finished. It's not very loud, and surprisingly picks almost everything up.. I guess this is a more of a basic model as far as robot vacuums go but I didn't want to spend a lot of time programming or trying to figure out special features.
<br>
<br>It was competitively priced, and has turned out to be really convenient. The only thing that I'm not thrilled about is that the waste container needs to be to emptied/cleaned often. I wish I would have bought a model where that's done automatically.

Turns out this model doesn't allow you to turn off the remote (no power on/off button). So to save batteries in the remote just take them out while not in use. Also, to turn off the auto timer just point the remote at the vacuum (I did it while it was placed in charger, don't know if that matters) and hold down the lower middle button on remote until it beeps twice. (a few seconds) I clean it out pretty much each time because my long hair sheds everywhere and if you don't take care of that it gets too hard to untangle on the brush, wheels etc. Very easy if you do it more often.

I didn’t want to spend as much money, and I didn’t want all the extra smart features, I don’t like the idea of an internet connected robot running around my house, even if it is an over sized hockey puck. So anyway, this was the model for me. My experience is that if you follow the instructions and ensure that you’ve protected all your cords, or moved them off the floor, folded all fringe under your rugs (and in my case used masking tape to keep it there), then you’ve set yourself (and the robot) up for success.

<br>It does a sort of randomized pattern and sometimes clearly misses areas. It also has about 900 square feet to cover, and it runs out of battery before it finishes the entire area. Sometime I’ll need to do two runs in a day, to make sure it gets everything.

While it is useless for its intended purpose, the entertainment value of this little guy is not to be missed. From its suicide attempts of driving over a cliff at the top of the stairs or hanging itself on any available electronics cord (but only when I'm not home), to its complete lack of spatial awareness whereby it gets lost 5 feet from base, this product has provided me with literally HOURS of amusement.
<br>
<br>I'm glad I initially set it up to vacuum in the evenings when I'm home because it refuses all attempts to shift its schedule and I would hate to miss its existential crisis when it runs into the couch unexpectedly, despite the fact that the couch has never moved. Fortunately, the shrill and panicky beeping alerts people in the next county that it has encountered a problem that it cannot rectify.

US,B079QYYGF1,R37ZCQC0CKHYLY,"Great for daily use, great if you have pets",Color:Black | Style:11S,"We have hardwood and tile throughout our house with a high-pile rug in one room. We also have lots of plants and two cats, one of whom has long fluffy fur that he seems to shed year round. Before we purchased this robovaccum our floors were regularly covered in fallen fern leaves, cat food crumbs, hair both human and feline, scattered cat litter, and whatever other debris has gotten tracked in.
<br>
<br>It does great on our our hard floors. I wasn't expecting it to be able to traverse the rug without getting stuck because its basically shag and has fringe on two sides, but it seems to do just fine moving around. It doesn't get everything out of the rug fibers but it gets a lot. I wouldn't say that this is a great product for deep cleaning your floors, but it is great for daily maintenance of your floors. We purchased this a little over 3 weeks ago and have been using it 4-5 times a week. I have to empty it every time we run it because it picks up a surprising amount. Now I just use my dyson to deep clean the rug and high traffic areas once a week. I love that I don't have to regularly pull out furniture to get all the dust bunnies that build up underneath. Someone visiting my home, knowing that we've got pets, would probably assume that I spend at least 4 hours a week vacuuming based on how clean the floors are on any given day, when in reality I'm spending an hour or less. What would you do with 3-4 more hours a week? It allows me to be more productive and dedicate more time to self-care. That alone is worth the cost of this product, imo.
<br>Some specific notes: 1) It's pretty good about not eating cords but will sometimes get stuck on them. When a cord does get stuck, its always been easy to unwrap and the cord isn't damaged. 2) It's good at not running off of ledges. We leave the basement door open so our cats can access their litter box downstairs and it goes right up to the edge without going over. 3) If you have carpet throughout your house, you may not have the same experience as it seems to do a fine job on carpet, but does a great job on hard floors. 4) It doesn't always find its dock right away when it needs to charge but I don't mind putting it back so this hasn't been an issue for me. 5) After a few weeks I am starting to see my long-haired cat's fur build up around the roller bar so I will probably need to plan to cut that off the roller every couple of months with how frequently I use it.
<br>
<br>Over all, I highly recommend this product. It is a great value for daily cleaning and saves me time.",是,5,Ryan Harris,2023-02-27

US,B07R295MLS,R2788CBJ4166XE,"I really wanted to like this, but...",Style:RoboVac 11S MAX,"To preface this review, I always read lots of reviews before purchasing higher priced items so I'm not jumping into something blindly. In that sense I guess the vacuum lived up to its decent reviews but it definitely fell short in several areas.
<br>After recently getting two new puppies I decided to try out another robot vac to avoid manually Swiffering the floor every other day. The Eufy had good reviews compared to others and the price pointy was acceptable. I'll start out with the pro's for the device, then move on to the con's.
<br>Pro's:
<br>great suction
<br>great sidewall cleanup
<br>thorough mapping of the area meant nothing was missed
<br>price point
<br>noise - it's pretty quiet
<br>cleaning out the bin was simple
<br>
<br>Con's:
<br>The detachable brushes pop off ALL THE TIME!
<br>Did I mention that the brushes come off constantly?
<br>it easily gets stuck on kitchen mats and even very low pile rugs/carpets
<br>
<br>While you can see that the pro's outnumber the con's, that main con item was a deal breaker for me. The two spinning brushes literally popped off every time the robot ran, and this is on my wood floors with just a thin mat by the front door. This required me to stop what I was doing, locate the brush(es) and pop them back on so that cleaning could continue. Several times they would pop off and I couldn't find them for hours or even days. Obviously this detracted from the whole purpose of having a robovac. While I understand the design thought for the brushes to be detachable, in practice it does not work so well. I ended up using this for about two weeks before I finally had enough and returned it. For now I'm back to manually sweeping until I can find a better solution. :(

This vacuum is incredibly easy to set up and use, and it's a huge time-saver when it comes to cleaning my floors.
<br>
<br>One thing I love about the eufy RoboVac is its slim design. It's incredibly compact and lightweight, so it can easily navigate under furniture and other tight spaces that larger vacuums can't reach. Despite its small size, this robot vacuum has powerful suction that does an amazing job of picking up dirt, dust, and other debris from my floors.
<br>
<br>The BoostIQ technology is another great feature that sets this vacuum apart from the rest. It automatically adjusts the suction power based on the type of flooring, so it can easily transition between hardwood floors and carpets without any issues. Plus, the multiple cleaning modes allow me to customize the cleaning process based on my specific needs.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would highly recommend the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S (Slim) to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality robot vacuum.

US,B07R295MLS,R1G5T8AQI25QA,Not bad,Style:RoboVac 11S MAX,"Boy there's so many things to say. First I appreciate the fast shipping from the seller and the item was well packed. The best way to review this is to take it point by point.
<br>Cons
<br>1. This vacuum is no more quiet than the shark vacuum I had had for years. It's not exceptionally quiet and if I'm on the phone I actually have to stop it so that I can hear better.
<br>2. This vacuum doesn't seem to be dedicated to a room or rooms in particular. What I mean is my shark vacuum did bounce around in verticals diagonals etc., But it seemed to like to stay in one particular room for a while then go to another one, and so forth. This vacuum beep bops around going all over the place.
<br>3. This vacuum does not recognize magnetic boundary strips and is powerful enough to climb up the base of a pedestal stand ultimate getting stuck. It would be far better if it would recognize the magnetic boundary strips like my shark vacuum did.
<br>4. Does not work in conjunction with an app and cannot be controlled via voice or your phone.
<br>Regarding the cons, you pretty much get what you pay for and I was looking for a relatively low-cost vacuum.
<br>Pros
<br>1. This vacuum is controlled by a remote control which it first didn't seem all that great, but I've come to realize it's extremely helpful.
<br>2. The remote control pretty much works like a remote control car with the directionals. It's nice to be able to back it up if need be. However they're remote control will also control the intensity of the vacuum suction which has three levels. In addition you can tell the vacuum to stay in one relative area and it will circle and circle expanding the circle to ensure that all the dirt is picked up. This remote control will also allow you to tell the vacuum to go back to the docking station. Furthermore you can program the vacuum to go begin vacuuming any particular time. However it will not allow you to set what days you want to vacuum or not. This is not a big deal to me because I like it to run everyday.
<br>3. This vacuum will also turn sharp corners and work along edges. With remote control you can tell the vacuum to either do edging, concentrate an area, or just go willy-nilly.
<br>4. The vacuum has a low profile so it's excellent for getting under furniture.
<br>5. The docking station footprint is small not bulky like some.
<br>6. Even though the vacuum does not recognize boundary strips it knows when it's nearest step and will turn around.
<br>7. So far this vacuum has had no trouble finding its docking station. My shark vacuum always seem to get lost on its way home. It was like a bad puppy I had to keep pushing it and pushing it to go work needs to go.
<br>8. If this vacuums battery runs low during the specified runtime (likely due to suction power settings), it will return to the docking station and recharge then begin to finish his vacuuming.
<br>All in all it's a pretty good vacuum for the price. Keep in mind that this is not meant to deep clean your carpets basically this is surface dirt on carpeting. It has an excellent job on the hardwood floors which most of my home is. This vacuum makes life easier because I don't have to lift the furniture or push furniture all the way anymore to get underneath it. So if you're looking for a robot vacuum for a reasonable price to do the everyday vacuuming then this is a good one for you.",是,4,Jen,2023-02-14

US,B079QYYGF1,R1FUQ8INCKVD1W,"fantastic nimble device , this is a steal , love it",Color:Black | Style:11S,"I would also call myself a ROOMBA veteran like another reviewer did, and I think my first ROOMBA was possibly at 300 pet series and then I had a 600 pet series for at least 10 years. I did not realize how dysfunctional it had become, because I had an excellent house cleaner. Long story short, the housecleaner went on a prolonged vacation, and I found myself realizing that I had a dinosaur as a ROOMBA and needed an urgent replacement. Being used to the old ROOMBAs, I was not familiar with all the fancy new options, like you get a bigger dustbin or that they map your house or you get a remote control, and I gave it a long thought but I really did not feel I needed that. I have a rather small house, and random cleaning pattern has always worked well for me. But what I needed was a robot that can navigate under furniture that sits a little lower without getting stuck underneath it all the time, and can navigate up and down flat carpets without turning them over all the time and getting stuck. Also, I should mention I have 2 cats. And this little device fits that bill, it cleans extremely well, navigates around and under all my furniture without problems, and is also so quiet compared to my old ROOMBA and it 'bumps into furniture very gently and quietly.
<br>What was a surprise is, that it must have a different sensing mechanism compared to ROOMBA, so the EUFY tried vehemently to get into our gas fireplace dragging all the little stones out of it -some decorative larger stones out of my garden, placed as a barrier, fixed that problem. And it can't sense stairs if the edges leading down to them are wood and very smooth: I had to learn that the hard way, the first time EUFY tumbled down I thought my cats had pushed it, the second time I actually pulled out the instruction manual and read it, and there it warns you about the smooth wood edges ...lol. But I have to say, EUFY took both tumbles with grace, and now my laundry hamper serves as an obstacle if I use Eufy on the second floor. And yes, of course, it cleans very well, it is always full of debris no matter how long or short I keep it running and the dustbin is easy to clean and the brushes also seem to be less of a hassle compared to the old ROOMBA ones. EUFY is a steal for that price [ I bought it for about $120 !!] I would get a second one if I had a bigger house. But it is also so lightweight, I can carry it upstairs easily if needed.

Deploying is easy. It doesn't map the house or anything--push On and it comes out and vacuums. That's it. Which is fine--I wanted simple. However, the spinning brushes can't make it from hardwood onto the rug. They get caught in the area rug and pop off. I ended up taking the side brushes off and as a result it doesn't clean as well as it could. It will actually avoid larger patches of dirt such as dirt tracked in on a shoe. Also, it took 5 tries to get it to go home to its base. It gets confused easily. There are a lot of ways this little robot could go wrong. I think it will probably be better than nothing, but we got it for pet hair for a pet we don't have yet so it's too soon to tell.

It picked up way more pet hair than I expected (we have 2 short haired dogs and 1 cat) and we get a lot of dirt brought in from them and our shoes. The only down side is I feel like it be more efficient if it didn't just bounce back and forth and followed more of a back and forth pattern. Also we wouldn't have to contantly watch where we are stepping. We can only run it while we are home and available to ""babysit"" because we do have 1 peice of trim between the kitchen/living room that it gets stuck on, but its a chucky, more square peice of trim that we intend to replace and we knew it might be a problem for any robot vacuum, and it is, but no biggie.",是,5,jesserica,2023-02-11

It was quieter than our old roomba, which was a big reason we wanted to purchase a new robot vacuum. For the year we owned it, it did its job picking up dog hair and dirt on our main tile floors not having to hit much carpeted areas of the house. I will say, with long dog hair you had to clean the main brush roller quite frequently to keep it clean and clear. Unfortunately after only 1 year and 2 weeks of ownership it would just stop working after a few minutes of running with the 4 beeps and solid red light. This indicates that the main brush roller was clogged or blocked in some way. I used all the troubleshooting methods recommend to resolve this by Eufy and that I could find online short of taking the vacuum apart which I was not comfortable with. I opened a case with Eufy and I was told, sorry for the inconvenience, but you are out of warranty so here is the link to a buy a replacement brush motor and the instructions to replace it. 2 weeks out of warranty and i have to buy a replacement motor and dissect the thing to try and fix it. Ideally they would have had some sympathy and sent the replacement or at least said sorry, let us send you the replacement brush. Meanwhile I've had my Roomba for 7 years and while it's still noisy... it's still running without issue. I guess it's time to look at the new Roombas for my next robot vacuum which is unfortunate because I do hate leaving bad reviews and wanted to be a good reviewer of the Eufy brand like everyone else.",是,2,Danielle S,2023-02-05

I purchased the Eufy 11S Max and after only four days of vacuuming the same rooms, the dust chamber as shown in the photo was showing incredible amounts of dirt, including particles and crumbs that must have been deeply imbedded in the carpet. The increase in suction from 1300pa in the original Eufy to 2000pa in the new one makes a big difference. I am using the new Eufy twice a week in the heavily used rooms and the original one in the more lightly used areas. Note: this is for a 2000 sf, home with two adults, no pets.

US,B079QYYGF1,RE6ITAVP60F02,Satisfied,Color:Black | Style:11S,"I’ve never had one of these little vacuums before, so my review is based solely on what I think of this one without having anything to compare it to.
<br>
<br>My whole main floor is hardwood and tile with area rugs, so in an effort to keeps things a little more tidy I felt like I needed a product like this. It actually works pretty great, but I wouldn’t rely on this alone to keep my floors clean. It doesn’t cover everything in a very methodical way. I know I can program it to do a single room or go around a perimeter but that wouldn’t really work for the layout of my home. It gets hung up on my kitchen stools (which isn’t the fault of the product), so I have to put them all on the counter before I get this started. Also, dining room chairs are a problem; too many chair legs to navigate. With a formal dining room and a kitchen dining area that’s 12 chairs I’m moving or placing on tables. Once I’ve put all the effort into putting chairs and stools on tables and counters it almost seems like what’s the point in using a robovac; I may as well just get the upright vacuum out.
<br>As far as the vacuum functions go I am very satisfied. The suction is surprisingly good. And it does pick up everything in its path. For me, this has been a great little supplemental cleaning tool; but, like I said, I’d never rely on it alone to keep my floors clean. Plus it’s funny to see how my cat reacts to it. Overall, I’m satisfied with the quality and function of the product.",是,4,"emily, etc., etc.",2023-01-25

US,B079QYYGF1,R21041MILIQ5BH,"Doesn't Require an App, But Does Require Babysitting",Color:Black | Style:11S,"I saw so many reviews on how many people ""love their Eufy"" that when I had to replace my old Deebot, I decided to try a Eufy. The main selling points for me were 1) doesn't require an app, 2) low clearance, 3) positive reviews on suction power, 4) price.
<br>
<br>While I know a lot of people like having an app that allows them to control their robot vacume cleaners, I'd rather have one that I can push a button and it goes about its job without supervision. For me, that's the whole point of having a robot - it does what it's supposed to do without my having to think about it and/or monitor it after I've picked up the floor.
<br>
<br>This one comes with a remote control, which is kinda cool, but again, only if you want to have to monitor and/or direct it.
<br>
<br>When I got this vacume cleaner, I set it up and pushed the On button to do a test run. I was surprised at how random the path it vacumed was - it entered most rooms, vacumed 2 paths at a 90 degree angle to each other, then left the room! I thought it might do better with a full charge, so returned it to its charging dock in the laundry room.
<br>
<br>Without my programming it, it started bumping around in the laundry room several hours later, so I let it loose and watched it to see what it would do. I was surprised that it vacumed over the Exact Same Paths it had already vacumed, and ignored every other part of the rooms and hallways! I experimented with the remote for a while, to see if I could get it to be more thorough, but quickly got frustrated with the need to babysit a robot, so let its programming take over. I was surprised and disappointed that it kept vacuming the paths it had already covered.
<br>
<br>I thought that perhaps the repetitive paths were part of it mapping my house, so tried it a third time - and found it kept vacuming the Exact Same Paths Over and Over while ignoring the rest of the rooms. What was even more frustrating was that it typically only vacumed 4 paths in each room before moving on to the next.
<br>
<br>I can say that it did only a decent job picking up lint, hair and dirt on the first pass, but need to point out it kept picking up lint, hair and dirt, on every other pass it did over the exact same paths, so it's not great at cleaning either.
<br>
<br>I cleaned it, packed it up and returned it. Did some more digging and bought a Roborock which has a better understanding of what a robot is supposed to do. So far, so good with that purchase.",是,3,tezcat,2023-01-25

It does wander around in no discernable pattern but the room is clean when done. This random movement isn't an issue for me bc I don't sit and watch it.

I bought this one for less than $ 200, because I didn't want to spend $ 800 for a fancy one as I wasn't sure if our dogs would murder it... They really don't seem to mind it! Maybe the decibel difference is better with this than our normal vacuum? I wouldn't run this one when I'm not home, as I'd like to keep an eye on it... it's kind of like a puppy: it gets stuck in corners, it gets caught on lamp cords, my phone charger, my Ethernet cord, the dogs' rope toys... I have to walk around first and pick things up... It does a great job of sucking up 99 % of what it passes over on tile. It's not quite as efficient on carpet, though, and leaves crumbs behind. I clean it out after every use and it's always full; then I return it to it's base. It does a random job bumping around, but eventually passes over most of the floor space. It's a great help as my dogs track in dirt, leave hair everywhere, chew up their cookies wherever and leave crumbs all over... I've been using this for a month now and it's a great way to get the house cleaned faster. I'll start it, then I'll do dishes and laundry- by the time I'm done, the Eufy has got the floors (mostly) vacuumed! I'm happy with it! Hopefully the mechanisms keep up functioning well.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2LC6OBH4PB1EH,Review after 9 months,Color:Black | Style:11S,"For reference: this is my first robot vacuum, so I don't know how it compares. I run it on low pile carpet about 1x/week . My regular vacuum is a V8 Dyson cordless. Family of 2 adults and a toddler; no pets. Hair, crumbs, dust...but not really a heavy load.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Slim and fits under furniture easily, even a very low bed frame. I love this.
<br>-Pretty effective. Definitely keeps the house clean between ""real"" vacuums, works well on edges.
<br>-The cannister generally lasts 2 vacuums before I have to empty. Not bad.
<br>
<br>Cons, especially after 9 months of use:
<br>-After 9 months, the battery doesn't last to clean my ~600 sq ft upstairs. Seems very inefficient and takes at least 2 hours. My husband hates the sound (quiet, but whiny) and my toddler is scared of it; I'd run it more if I didn't have to avoid them, but basically it means my whole floor doesn't always get clean.
<br>-Even when the battery lasted the whole cleaning, my Dyson is far better. Period. Will pick up at least a quarter cannister more, especially of fine dust, right after I've run the Eufy. Eufy is more successful on my hardwood floors.
<br>-After 9 months, the closure on the cannister is broken. So, when emptying, I have to carefully remove and keep it sandwiched together to go empty it. Not a big deal, but I'd expect better after &lt;1 year.",是,3,Matt C.,2023-01-24

Price point is too high to have this problem. I'm not sure why this product even made it to market to be quite frank.

<br>It also gets bumps into my stove, refrigerator, AC and any appliances that are black in color. It also does not work as in low-lit spaces. It often gets stuck under my bed, on entertainment station, and on top of bar stool bases often. The ""solution"" to this is to use magnetic strips. The devise should come with these since it is an obvious short-coming of the device. Price point is too high to have this problem.

US,B07R295MLS,R1RIZ9IR7AV82K,Not as good as Roomba,Style:RoboVac 11S MAX,"I got this vacuum to replace our roomba (it’s lasted for years; just wanted to try a new one). This one seems “dumber” than the Roomba. It will get stuck on the edge of a rug and just sit there and spin until the battery dies. The Roomba would stop and beep to alert you that it was stuck. This vacuum also gets tangled in cords something fierce. I know you are supposed to pick them up, but it found a lamp cord under a bed and spun itself (the wheels and the brushes) around the cord until the battery died. That was fun to untangle…
<br>
<br>One positive is that it is more gentle than the Roomba that we have. It will stop short of banging into most things and typically only lightly tap them. So if you’re concerned about baseboard or chair leg scuffs, this is a good option. It’s also very quiet, which is nice.
<br>
<br>The sucking power seems good and it picks up a lot of dust. However, we set it down in front of a broken chip and it spun and flung pieces of the chip around while only vacuuming up like 30% of the chip. I ended up using a dust pan.
<br>
<br>One thing I don’t like is that you can only program it to run one time of day and it runs that time every day. I’d like to have to ability to select which days I want it to run. Unfortunately, it’s all or nothing. Also, something happened at one point where, even though the time was set correctly, it began running in the middle of the night ( I have it set for 8am). I tried reprogramming it and it continued. Eventually, we unplugged it, turned it off, removed the batteries from the remote and started all over. After googling the “phantom run time” of Eufy, that is what other users suggested. That seemed to work- for now.
<br>
<br>Overall not too bad for the price, but definitely not the smartest machine. We affectionately call her Rosie and frequent tell her she’s she’s not very bright. It’ll get up most of the visible dirt so I’m ok with her shortcomings.",是,3,Gina,2023-01-17

US,B07R295MLS,R1IS5W0ZNWJH7K,A Lot Of Power For The Money,Style:RoboVac 11S MAX,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;I have now owned this unit for 2 months, wanted to wait to review. First my review will be to the point, and I have a 5 year old mid priced Roomba that is still working, was impressed by the reviews, the price for this unit, thought I would try it.
<br>First off it’s so much quieter then my Roomba, has longer battery life and doesn’t vacuum like a drunk person. I do have 3 non shedding dogs, we have a single story 2,100 sq ft home. No carpet, all wood or tile. We do have several rugs, I put a short video showing how well it transitions from wood to rugs.
<br>When I first got it I was very concerned about the parts being very cheap, has more plastic then my Roomba, I did buy the extra filters, roller parts. Seems after running at least 5 days a week for two months the parts are holding up well, did change to a new filter this week.
<br>Some of the reviews I read people didn’t clean it after every use, I personally don’t see how they don’t need to clean and empty after every use, we do and that is a downside that with the Roma I didn’t have to do but it didn’t pick up as much!
<br>I would recommend this unit, I was willing to pay more but the people’s reviews convinced me to try this one, no regrets!
<br>I love that the unit has a orange light that stays on till it’s fully charged, blue light means ready. I don’t like that it doesn’t charge and continue to clean like my Roomba did. It is better at docking then my Roomba was.
<br>I use the max setting every time, as you can see in the picture that it’s a lie that my breed of dog doesn’t shed, I think it cleans better then the Roomba, also handles all my rugs better then the Roomba. I just pick up my bath rugs before running it.
<br>90% of the time it makes it way back to charge on it’s own, that’s a gift! We have beds high enough for the it to go under, hate when it dies under a king bed!
<br>I would recommend this unit, I hope it’s still going after 5 years like my Roomba, I hope my review helps you make the decision to go for it.",是,4,janice poolson,2023-01-10

I was initially impressed because it was super quiet. However, I now understand the review that said it was like a toddler. It would run 30 seconds and get stuck under the recliner. I would go retrieve it and restart it and walk away, and 30 seconds later, it was stuck under the recliner. I would move it to a different room, and it would wander its way back to the other room within two minutes and be stuck again under the same recliner. I moved it again, so the recliner was not accessible and then it got stuck under the sofa. Then it was stuck on the Christmas tree stand. Then it was stuck on a rug. You catch my drift. I wanted a robot so I could let it do its thing without me having to do the work. Decided it is easier to run a regular vacuum cleaner or use my old iRobot because the new one doesn’t getting anything done quickly because it gets stuck everywhere. On a positive note, the dustbin is a lot bigger than my old iRobot. That would be really nice if it would actually run long enough to fill it up.

It didn't come with instructions, which I thought was weird, but was easy enough to figure out without them. First run through the upper level (all vinyl plank) it did ok. I understand it's a robot and it's trying to figure out the house layout, but within the first five minutes it threw itself down the stairs - twice. Second run a few days later, I remedied the steps issue by putting chairs in the way. It did ok with the area rug we put down, but the little brushes would sometimes come off. Noticed the robot did not want to get close to the walls, and would leave a six inch distance between itself and the wall. Not super excited about this. Third run, it resolved the steps issue and hasn't tried violence any more. It still has an issue with the space between the wall. I was also expecting it to do better with getting under the bedroom furniture, which it gets under, but we have a couple of dogs and their hair likes to tumbleweed under there. At least it pushed the hair out? Over all I am pretty neutral on this robot. It served it's purpose, as I wanted to see if I would like a robot.

We have 3 large dogs who track in a lot of dirt so this gets run several times a day. The dirt compartment holds more than I thought it would. It’s easy to empty. (I recommend regularly cleaning hair and string from the brushes, which are easy to remove.) It can seem as if it “skips” over dirt but, if you let it continue, you’ll see that it’s following a path and will roll back over it eventually. I turn it on and just let it do it’s thing. When I come back, the floors are clean. It did take a few weeks for it to learn the general layout of the room. We use it far less often in other areas of our house so it sometimes gets stuck when not used in the kitchen just because it doesn’t know the layout as well.

US,B07R295MLS,RSBTU1NDMZS56,Really Works!,Style:RoboVac 11S MAX,"I was skeptical but I really wanted to try a Robovac. I chose this brand and model because I read an article that did a full review with videos. I was surprised how well this unit worked. The first time I ran it I emptied the collection tray three times just to see how much it was actually picking up. The tray had a lot of debris in it and my floors had just been vacuumed the day before! I ran it every day since and the tray still had to be emptied each time. The low profile gets under the door of the dishwasher, refrigerator and barstools. There is no rhyme or reason to its movement. Sometimes it runs into an object and other times it senses the object before it bumps it. The vacuum may inch its way around, it may turn 180 or it may bounce off in a completely different direction. It got stuck one time when the front got pushed up in the air so the wheel kept going, but that was because the area rug was curled. It has ""off roaded"" over the wood moulding on my fireplace hearth, which is about a half inch in thickness. It vacuumed the hearth and drove off to do the rest of the house. My house is not open concept but it does every room during one cycle which is, I believe, 100 minutes long. Because of its haphazard directions I would suggest the vacuum be run every day or every other day to keep up with the dirt that gets tracked into the house. I am extremely pleased with this RobotVac. I can't believe how much dirt it's picking up, even after running every day.",是,5,MeAtHome,2023-01-01

Near tears I hated it. I had typed out a review and I'm glad I didn't submit it though. After reading more in the manual, and reading some other peoples comments I tried it again. I use the single room mode and the max suction and it does the job. I actually kinda love it now! I just use a couple of 2x2s to block off the rooms that I don't have doors to, and then I have a reclining sectional that the vacuum wants to get stuck behind so I shove a couple blocks of wood there too. It is crazy the amount of cat hair and dirt that it picks up, even when you think your floors are clean. And guess what? It makes me want to mop my floors. (well, it's only been one week, so we'll see how long that lasts). I have an area rug that it will not pick up as well as my push vacuum, but that's ok. It does seem to wander around aimlessly, and it seems to get lost trying to find it's way home even when it's like 6 feet away from the charging base, but that's not a deal breaker for me. I will not use this unless I am home, as I have cats, and I sure don't want to come home and find a hairball smeared all over the house. I am noticing less cat hair in the air as well, when I vacuum with the push vac, the exhaust will blow cat hair into the air. I don't have that with this little robot.

<br>
<br>I'll preface that statement by saying that this works ok. It has a battery-controlled remote control to set up schedules and options, but after using a bluetooth device for the other vacuum, it's not as impressive.
<br>
<br>My major issues are that the bristles on it looked incredibly beat up just after one or two uses. It doesn't seem to do a very thorough job and seems to miss areas. It seems to get stuck over small obstacles very easily. But so far, it's been able to return to its base to recharge and over time it'll eventually get to every square inch of the carpet.
<br>
<br>I do like that it has variable suction settings, and it does seem to pull up an astonishly gross amount of dust and pet hair. So overall—yes it's pretty good—but after using a fancier model, it's just a little less dazzling. It's fairly basic, but it works and gets the job done. If that's all you're looking for and don't want or need something that uses an app, and you want something a little less expensive, this might be just the robot for you.",是,4,psychopompous,2022-12-30

I have a wood-burning stove, four dogs (big and small) and plenty of weather conditions to cope with here in Maine. I also have new flooring to keep clean. Eufy works every day, sometimes twice depending on traffic and what toy the new pup has decided to destroy. He (the dog, not the Eufy!) also loves to raid the woodbox and tears up firewood constantly. Eufy cleans up the small woodchips with no problem including what gets on the utility rugs. I empty after every use. It is not a big chore. Eufy DID somehow get re-programmed to operate in the middle of the night. I kept forgetting to figure out how to change it. On the third night, I was awakened once again by my poor, stuck Eufy. Did I mention my 4 dogs? Yes, I experienced the dreaded s---show after antibiotics caused another pup to react badly.
<br>I figured Eufy would be dead after that experience but I became very familiar with all of the working parts of Eufy. Took him all apart, cleaned him very carefully, reassembled him, and learned how to turn off the scheduled late-night cleaning. Works perfectly, even after all that.
<br>
<br>I was so pleased with this Eufy I ordered a second one. My error. The one I ordered was smarter than me so I had to send it back as I had no desire to teach my phone how to vacuum. Ordered another but discovered it was not a Eufy 11S Max but a similar model with a little less suction. Back it went and I re-ordered the one I really wanted.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- It takes a beating! We have three kids, two toddlers, one of which thinks the vacuum is the best thing ever and is always ""playing"" with it. He sits on it, pushes it, flips it, and it keeps on vacuuming!
<br>-It cleans up everything! Again, three kids, two toddlers, and now add a dog. This thing handles all of the messes plus some!
<br>-The filter really works to contain allergens! Keep up with the monthly maintenance (every robovac requires monthly) and you will notice the difference.
<br>-The parts are cheap and easy to replace when you do your monthly maintenance. I can do the entire maintenance cycle in 5 minutes. The iRobot was not as easy and the parts were expensive.
<br>-Easiest system to empty without having to worry about a mess.
<br>-It does an excellent job cleaning! The suction is not the most powerful, but it still gets almost everything!
<br>-The remote! It beats every single app! Simple, easy, clean cut. Anyone can figure it out and use it! Set a schedule for cleaning, return it to the dock, start the cleaning, change the cleaning mode/method, change the suction power, even use it to find the vacuum! The remote is awesome! I was skeptical at first, but I prefer it over any app.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-The cleaning pattern is not the best. More random than anything. It will get your whole house, just seems inefficient.
<br>-The waste bin is a bit on the small side, so make sure you empty it every time it finishes cleaning. It will hold any entire cleaning cycle though.",是,5,Amazon Customer,2022-12-19

If you are buying it to keep ahead of pet hair you need to clean the brush after each use. You need to empty it after each use. It will be full of dirt and hair. If you have problems go to their website and it has several videos to show you how to fix them. It goes under beds, dressers and really cleans. It also finds every cord on the floor to tangle in... I usually have to free it 1-2 times as it finds things I do not know about. I would suggest before using it you run a vacuum over the floor to remove bulk of the material on the floor. Because of the small container it fills rapidly if you do not.. It makes a great supplement to regular vacuuming. Run it a couple times a day to help keep down the dirt tracked in by those dog paws or little feet of children. For a heavy shed on your dog brush to reduce the hair, use a broom to sweep up clumps and then vacuum. Yes it will pick this hair up but you will spend more time cleaning the vacuum. Consumer reports listed this as number 1 for dog hair. I have a 100 lb Belgian Malinois so he puts out a lot of hair.

US,B07R295MLS,R17BFDQRZTKA7K,"It’s great, when it works.",Style:11S MAX,"To preface, this is my second Eufy robot vacuum that I’ve bought, and I bought this one solely because of the amazing experience I had with my first vacuum. So for Black Friday, I decided to get a vacuum/mop combo, and everything has just been downhill since there.
<br>
<br>When it works, the vac/mop is amazing. However, it rarely ever works. I can’t count the innumerable times I’ve gotten the error message that the vacuum is ‘stuck’, and by ‘stuck’ I mean it’s trying to go through a wall with nothing blocking it on 3 out of 4 sides. I thought maybe it was the map of my house, so I deleted the old map, picked EVERYTHING up off the floor except my furniture and made a new map. That solved the issue… until the app overwrote the new saved map and reverted to the map I had deleted days ago. It also will then create random new maps of an inverted floor plan which completely threw me for a loop, and the vacuum wouldn’t move more than 2 feet from the charging base without saying it’s stuck in the middle of my floor.
<br>
<br>I’d say it’s a 50/50 shot it finds its way back to the charging base, but it’s really more of a once in a blue moon situation. The charging base has never been moved, yet even if I pick the vacuum up and place it directly in front of the base it’ll do a 360° and start going in the completely wrong direction, then die in the middle of my house an hour later.
<br>
<br>As I was writing this review it decided mid clean it only wanted to do half of my house and went back to charge with over half of the battery life remaining (completely avoided both the living room and laundry room in my open concept house).
<br>
<br>For what you pay for, both the product and the app are extremely glitchy and not worth it whatsoever. I’d recommend going with the 11s max and just buying a spin mop. If I didn’t spend an unconscionable amount of money on this vacuum, I’d gladly throw it away.",否,2,Madison Hernandez,2022-12-14

US,B079QYYGF1,R29Q99KM3SBT1H,A basic workhorse of a robot vacuum,Color:Black | Style:11S,"Having been reading about robotic vacuums for a year I bought this one for several reasons: a review of it as best new product in 2018, and it was on sale and had a coupon making it a low risk for trying new technology. The vacuum runs in a seemingly random pattern but eventually cleans the entire area. I set up barriers where there were no doors and I wanted to keep it out. The Eufy kept trying to get past the barriers and clean more, a noble trait. I took it downstairs and let it loose; when it was done but could not return to its charging station upstairs, it just kept cleaning and cleaning until I rescued it. I would give it 10 stars for persistence, and for hard work.
<br>The reason for 4 stars is two-fold. First, its brushes get pet hair in them and it is a pain to clean, however, the included tool works great for this. Second, no robotic vacuum can compare to my Dyson for cleaning power.
<br>Other things I liked: there was a manual as well as a quick start guide included. Also included were a few spare items (filter and side brushes) as well as a cleaning tool.",是,4,pamela m,2022-12-12

I was amazed to see it bring itself 'home' to its charging station once the battery had depleated itself! Of course the first few times you will want to watch it travel around. And you really should so that you can catch any cords or other things that could get caught up in it. I blocked two rooms off the second time I used it. Some one said it learns your rooms and will work better every time. I don't know about that but so far I can see that it seems to favor the first room I tried it out in. I'm impressed. I moved my furniture some so that it could reach corners and such. The only fault I can find so far is that the little rotating brushes that stick out on the sides do tend to come off. Not a big deal. The vacuum came with replace ment brushes for the sides, pick to clean off the roller once it fills up and a spare filter. Good deal.",是,5,Auntie Joyce,2022-12-11

It ran into a tv tray hard enough to knock it over. Emptying the dust bin is annoying because dust goes everywhere and lint and hair stick to the filter. You really need a second vacuum handy whenever it’s time to clean the bin… which kind of defeats the purpose.

US,B07R295MLS,R3ALD3HE0MRNKW,Great little machine,Style:11S MAX,"I'm impressed how well it worked. It's first (and only run so far) is a bit erratic but it did the job. I have an open floor plan with kitchen island, entryway, dining area, long hall and bathroom that has dark gray wood laminate separated by a living room with light carpet and corner fireplace that makes an angled wall. The vacuum fits under the cupboard's kick plate and end tables but it's about a quarter inch too tall to fit under the sofa, loveseat and chair so it might take it a little bit to learn the boundaries for a more efficient pattern and reduce the erratic path. The space between coffee table and sofa was the only place it didn't get before it ran out of battery. I have an open stairway. It went to and along the edge without going over. It handled the entry rug and going from carpet to hardwood with not problem. It got the crumbs in the corners under the cupboards. It moved gently along my white trim and walls left no marks. Noise level is about the same as a fan and quieter than my upright and range's hood fan! I placed the home base charging unit under a 5' bench in a long hall entryway. It found it's way out and with a little help it's way back to charge when the battery got low. It had run for a good hour and 1/2 and cleaned all, but the little strip between the sofa and coffee table, with regular suction. The floor and carpet are clean. Emptying the dust bin is easy and to clean the filter simply rinse under running water and air dry. The brushes and rollers all snap on and off easily, so they're easy to clean. It comes with 2 filters, 4 brushes, a remote with batteries and a well designed cleaning utensil to clear roller brush of any hair or string that might wind around it. It works without Wi-Fi, one reason to purchase since I don't have internet. It also has a remote control so you can program it to clean on a schedule or steer it to specific area for a quick clean, like a remote control car. So far, I'm very impressed with its features and cleaning capability. I charged it over night so I'm not sure how long it takes to fully charge it. But after it recharged about an hour I 'drove' over to vacuum between the sofa and end table. Then a quick run on the 'footpath' in bedroom and back to base. I used the max suction and it's only a little louder than regular and still quieter than the upright. I'm impressed and very pleased. We'll see how long it lasts. It cost so much less than the Roomba my daughter has but so far seems to work as well. I loved hers, so I'm thrilled this one works so well and for more than half the cost.",是,5,IM,2022-12-08

US,B07R295MLS,R37C8SKZHY3L8B,Here’s why robo vacuums will NEVER be a thing.,Style:11S MAX,"Pros:
<br>- This thing is well-built and durable.
<br>- it does an excellent job of sucking up dust … for a while.
<br>- It is slim enough to go under my coffee table and night stands where my standard vacuum can’t go.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- AND NOW I REVEAL THE ULTIMATE negative about this vac (and probably all others) … there is only a one stage filter on this. ALL THE DUST goes straight into the HEPA filter!! There are no pre-filters. There isn’t even room for other filters on these small devices. Thus the HEPA filter is caked-up with fine dust within minutes. Its absolutely ridiculous. I predict that the people who are buying these vacuums will stop using them when they find out how time consuming it is to clean out the filters! A good vacuum MUST have at least 2 filters or a filter bag.
<br>
<br>FACTS:
<br>- Technology can shrink devices and make them autonomous but …. Dust and debris will always be around to clog-up filters. There’s no way around it.",是,2,Literary Vagabond,2022-12-04

US,B079QYYGF1,R17SZP4OAHQADZ,Well worth the money,Color:Black,"Ordered this 4 years ago. It's still going strong. I couldn't see speeding a lot of money on the high dollar one. So glad I didn't.
<br> It took almost a full year to convince my bulldog that it's not trying to eat anyone but, he now just finds it a minor annoyance while it cleans up his hair, very well I have to say.
<br> I have ceramic &amp; hardwood flooring. It does an excellent job, including area rugs as long as they don't have tassles. The furniture it does get under, it cleans those hard to reach areas very well and pushes the Hotwheel cars my grandson's get under there out &amp; sometimes plays with them all around the room.
<br> Learned to keep the bathroom door shut because it goes in and vacuums the walk-in shower stall. Water &amp; all.
<br>Drop sensor works very well, it has never fell down the steps, unlike my Bulldog.
<br>I'm changing the brushes at the moment because it has a problem with the dust mop. Left it out &amp; it saw it as some sort of threat. Seems it thinks it's taking it job &amp; keeps attacking it &amp; tangled up in it.
<br> I'll be ordering another one for the front part of my house. So I don't have to keep putting it up the steps &amp; it gets frustrated that the steps keep him from returning to his base &amp; and keeps beeping until you do so.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2SG88T2S2SO84,"Simple, solid design. Works as advertised.",Color:Black,"We've had this for 2 months. Didn't know what to expect. First, it doesn't connect to Wifi or need an app, which is actually great. So many things now require a complex setup and some elaborate third-party data sharing plan, this does not. Set up the base somewhere, and turn it on. It'll figure out what needs cleaning up.
<br>
<br>First run, it was brimming with hair and dirt after 20 minutes. With 2 dogs and a cat, every run it gathers a full load. It isn't quiet enough to not notice, and we stopped running it on a schedule - more once a day I'll push the top button to get it around the house. If a work call comes up, I can turn it off / pause it.
<br>
<br>The thing that impressed me was after a week it clogged up and the light went red. Inspecting it, the underside is really easy to open up and take apart. There's 1 tray with a filter that comes out, and a roller that comes out of its case entirely for easy cleaning and replacement. 2 side brushes also come out for cleaning and replacement. After removing tangled hair and some fuzz from probably the depths under our couches, it cleaned real quick, and after a charge was back to running fine.
<br>
<br>Overall, it's good design and does a good job. It's not magic; it will bump into things occasionally, but it's damn persistent. Will hit an obstacle and turn around it to get every possible nook and cranny. Sometimes it dies in a room possibly after getting stuck, so I grab it and put it back, but it's full of dirt and has done an admirable job. I'm completely won over with this guy.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2YFS8HGHMFRMC,Amazing little helper!,Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;Amazing this little helper! Totally impressed with how well it vacuums hardwood floors and low pile carpet in my 1,100 sqft range style home. The first time used, it collected quite a bit. Check out the video. When battery begins to run low, it automatically finds its recharging station. Mine ran about and hour. Which was a short in comparison to other reviewers. But then I discovered I had it on the heavy duty clean setting which uses more power. Then the second run after it recharged I switched it back to standard cleaning. That boost it up a bit. Recharge takes about 2-3 hours. I ran it for the last three days once a day to deep vacuum the floors. Each time the dirt basket became less and less. It can and does get stuck on some electrical cords on some occasions however it also frees its self other times it gets stuck. So after a few times of vacuum sessions, you will learn the areas you need to move cords. After that, it does it’s thing. I like that it gets underneath my bed where dust accumulates and under the sofas! For my sofas, I prepare by raising the sofas and putting the feet on 4x4 blocks raising them enough for the eufy to do its thing underneath. Sofa raising I am planning to do only once every two weeks or monthly. I am blown away by my little helper. It does not have all the bells and whistles like other models such as Bluetooth, wifi for remote turn on scheduling, more power etc, you really don’t need all the extra trimmings. I sure don’t…I just want it to clean the floors properly while I am home doing other things around the house. That it does. I would dare to say it cuts down on me vacuuming about 75%. The other 25% is for me dusting furniture, extreme corners that the eufy cannot get to, baseboard dusting, tables etc.
<br>I am happy thus far. If it there ever is an issue, I will update this review. Until then if there ever will be, I am enjoying my little helper vacuuming freeing me up to do other things. Well worth $126!",是,5,Jeff Bezoz,2022-11-29
US,B07R295MLS,R2CWQ27SABLEOK,Pleasantly surprised,Style:11S MAX,"With how many robot vacuums there are on the market, it can be daunting to choose one. I got sucked into the vacuum review spiral and was reading about all different models, their specs, their reviews, etc. After days of contemplation, I ended up deciding on this one. Here is my experience this far:
<br>
<br>-This is a random pattern device. It drives in a straight line until it senses or bumps an object, then readjusts (except in edge mode, where it follows the wall). Despite the random pattern, it cleans incredibly well and nearly covers my entire floor plan daily.
<br>
<br>-No fancy app with floor mapping, it just uses a controller to manually drive, start/stop, change functions, or set calendar start times. I actually chose this due to the lack of floor mapping, because now I can place it on different levels of the house throughout the week without confusing the little guy.
<br>
<br>-Great suction power! I haven’t seen it drive over something and leave it behind yet. It will get caught on small things like the edges of carpets, wires, etc. but if you make sure they’re up off the ground or not easily accessible, this device will maneuver easily around it.
<br>
<br>-The object sensing is pretty decent. It has some type of sensor that is able to see lighter colors (mainly white) and will redirect without touching them. Darker objects it will bump into and the front bumper will cause it to redirect. If you have white molding, this will definitely save your walls from scuffs!
<br>
<br>-The trap is easy to clean out, and I was highly surprised by how much it picks up daily! We have a 1,600sq Ft house and even when we ran it after we cleaned ourselves, it still managed to pick up a full bin of dirt. It does a decent job with long hair, but some will still get looped around the brush. Simply remove the brush and cut the hair out to clean.
<br>
<br>-While this isn’t the most sophisticated device on the market, if you’re looking for a great entry level model that works well while not breaking the bank, this is your sign to buy this one!",是,4,Devin,2022-11-29

US,B079QYYGF1,R1TAD8BWHCQFW0,Mice job on hardwoods and rugs,Color:Black,"I was put onto this model by Consumer R. They are right; not a lot of bells and whistles or complicated programs, it just does a good job. I unpacked it, put batteries in the remote, installed the sweeper brushes, and after a charging we were off to the races.
<br>Note: we tied up our power cords for the lamps, TV, Computer,.... picked up the rugs with tassels, dogs water dish, .... Then I hit the start button and watched it go.
<br>The remote is simple. The instructions aren't the best. It did a good job crawling under furniture, cleaning area rugs, and hardwood floors. Even though our house (1800 s.f. down) is clean, I was amazed at the volume of dust it collected! There was a fair amount of pet hair wound around the brush. I used the nifty cleaning tool with a blade for trimming hair off the brush. You must clean the collector basket, filters, and brush. They catch a surprising amount of dirt. If you are the type person who doesn't clean out your dryer lint basket regularly, this is probably not for you. Its simple to do and is so much easier than sweeping and dusting.
<br>The Eufy glides along fairly quietly in a random pattern. Its goofy but eventually cleans all the floors. It navigates over the hems of the rugs, tracks around table legs, scoots under the couch... After it finishes or has a low charge it finds its way back to the charging station. I have it scheduled for daily but I probably think a Monday-Thursday-Saturday schedule will be good enough.
<br>The result is we couldn't be more pleased. The floors are clean and the household dust is much less. In fact we are thinking of getting rid of our whole house air cleaner because this catches so much more dust and debris. As a result we have ordered a second one for the upstairs. Yes! I recommend it if you don't need a high tech floor sweeper. Simple is good.
<br>We have other Eufy products too. We get no free products or anything. We are just regular consumers endorsing a product which worked well for our home.",是,5,The Rabbit Whisperer,2022-11-27

<br>I’m constantly amazed by the amount of hair and dust this thing picks up.

<br>It certainly could be smarter and map your house, controlled from Wi-fi, or empty itself but this cost a fraction of those fancier models. Its slim, transitions from carpet to hardwood easily and won’t fall down the stairs.

I haven't pulled out my regular vac (except to do the carpeted stairs) since July. The suction isn't as good as a regular vacuum, but it goes over the areas 5xs. The battery life is good. I feel like it works better on hard surface flooring. It does get stuck on cords and belts and straps though. It does a good job on edges, and can get under furniture that even my lift away vac cannot reach. I love it! I call it 'My Little Buddy' because he's my best helper around the house. Totally worth every penny for the time I save. I have a 2700sf house and use it 2xs per week. It does need to be cleaned after EVERY use though. They filter needs cleaning, and you need spare parts (it comes with one set of spares). I bought generic spare parts on amazon and the filter didn't fit. Next time I'll buy factory ones. This model works using a remote or simply pressing the button on the vac. It does head to the charging station on its own when the battery gets low (very cool!). You really need the remote to operate it beyond the basic GO button, so if I knew that going into it, I might have opted for a model that has 3 buttons or more. It's is programmable though too, using the remote. The vac does get stuck on things in the house and you'll need to find it, if you can't hear it beeping.

I have a dog &amp; cat that shed a LOT in a one bedroom apartment with wooden floor and carpet so I’ve definitely put the vacuum through a good benchmark to see how good this vacuum performance and value is.
<br>
<br>Navigation - 7/10. It navigates slightly bumping into obstacles and turning until the path is clear. It has a remote you can control the unit with which is really nice if your trying to get under your couch for example or if it’s been running and misses a spot. I wish it had a mapping system where you could use the remote and show it where to go once and save the path, but for the price, I think the navigation is fine.
<br>
<br>Cleaning/suction power 8/10: it does a great job with dog and cat hair, litter my cat tracks out of its box, and small debris. Has no issues moving from Carpet to Hardwood, doesn’t damage or scratch anything. It doesn’t do a deep clean, but it’s perfect for pets and dust.
<br>
<br>Battery life and Cleaning Area Size - this works really well for one or two rooms large rooms. With 1 dog and 1 cat it needs to be emptied after every use. They include a tool to clean the roller and it’s very easy to take out and put back in. Haven’t had an issue with battery life since it sits on its base. If your desired cleaning area is more than 3 or 4 rooms max, you may want to look for something with better navigation that self empties.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3L6QQXTQ65UXT,"Perfect for the price, but you get what you pay for.",Color:Black,"Had high expectations based on reviews, and overall this little guy didn't disappoint.
<br>
<br>Cleaning
<br>Does an exceptional job. Its knack seems to be dog hair; we had our home professionally cleaned in the morning and ran this guy right after the cleaner left. It picked up an absolute ton of dog hair from hard surfaces and carpets, and continues to do so with every subsequent pass this week. Gross/awesome.
<br>
<br>Noise
<br>Super quiet. So quiet, in fact, that it's hard to hear when it's in trouble (multiple beeps) in a room with a closed door, a few rooms away, or with moderate background noise. That said, I'll take the tradeoff for how quiet this thing is during normal operation.
<br>
<br>Tech
<br>This is where it falls massively short. Granted, this is an inexpensive robotic vacuum so you get what you pay for. It can find and follow furniture and walls that extend all the way to floor level pretty reliably. However, it will constantly try to go under furniture that's just a tad too short for it, so it'll get stuck under dressers, low bed frames, etc. It also doesn't seem to ""learn"" where obstacles are, so you need to pick up **anything** that it can run over/ingest (cords, Alexas, dog toys, tags, bedding that droops to the floor, you name it), or it'll get stuck. And per the ""low noise"" comment above, you might not hear it beeping that it's in trouble. It also seems to have a hard time going in a straight line (pulls to the left). One positive, however, is the ease with which you can ""drive"" the vac with the remote. We've been doing that a lot lately, given the aforementioned inconsistencies with furniture, some loose objects, etc.
<br>
<br>Overall, would we pay what we paid again for it? Absolutely. This will probably relegate itself to our carpeted basement, and we'll get a more expensive one (with intelligent mapping, furniture detection, etc) to run on the main levels of the house.

<br>2. It gets caught on every wire! I nailed down the wires that must go across the floor so it would stop getting stuck on them and spin until it runs out of battery.
<br>3. It humps my floor lamp every time until the battery runs out.
<br>4. ""Single room cleaning"" - This function is a misnomer, this is truly a 30-minute time-limited cleaning. You cannot teach it the borders of a room, you have to close the door on it to limit it to a space for 30 minutes of vacuuming. So if you have an open floor plan you cannot limit it to the kitchen only for example.

We got the new one because the light on the old one had turned red while docked and periodically would not run, as scheduled--we think the battery is dying. We liked it well enough so we got the same thing, but the new one has not impressed. It will not go over the transitions between our vinyl flooring and tile, causing it to get stuck every night! Also, the bump sensor on it is way less sensitive. It just bulldozes over stuff. We have a small potty in the living room for our toddler. The old vac would sense it and avoid it, often before even touching it; the new one just bangs into it and pushes it around. Similarly, the old one would not run over your feet, but the new one just rolled right over my foot, which is funny since it wouldn't roll over the floor transition.

<br>So...I got a robo-vac this week. It’s like a Roomba, but is much much less expensive - a brand called Eufy. (Recommended by Consumer Reports). You do have to Eufy-proof the house before you let this thing loose. For example, we have diatenaceous earth under our bed to help prevent scorpions (a whole ‘nother story) and Eufy very much enjoyed vacuuming that up and spreading it around the room a bit. (It has the consistency of flour). It also is wearing some on its front proudly to show how hard it has worked. Eufy will also suck up any unsuspecting cords or cat toys that might be laying on the ground.
<br>When we turned on Eufy last night, the first thing it found was the nozzle to the shop vac in our utility room. I swear it was trying to have vacuum sex. I about died laughing when I found it “humping” the nozzle repeatedly. My husband thinks the children will not be attractive.
<br>I also wondered how my cats would react to it. They are wary, but very curious, and follow Eufy around the house. They are not sure what to think yet about Eufy, but because it’s small and pretty quiet, they seem inclined to think it’s probably ok.
<br>Eufy is not as smart as a Roomba, so it doesn’t “map” the rooms it’s been in. So far it particularly loves to vacuum under our bed, under the dining room table and in the bathroom. It has completely ignored some parts of the house thus far. However, because Eufy is a supplemental vacuum to help suck up cat hair off the floors, this is ok. Every little bit helps. When I emptied Eufy’s dustbin today, it had collected enough hair for another cat. So we are welcoming Eufy to our home and looking forward to the entertainment and reduced cat hair environment it will provide in the future.
<br>
<br>I also bought a new Eufy (Neufy) on August 24, 2022. We are running these daily, one upstairs, one downstairs. The original Eufy is still going strong, although we've had to replace the brushes on both as they sometimes get caught on stuff. Replacement brushes are pretty cheap, so it's no big deal. I'd highly recommend these little vacuums, especially if you hate vacuuming like I do.",是,5,Monica Ojendyk,2022-11-04

It seems to sense where someone walks as it keeps filling people and turn around when you stepped over it but as soon as there is an obstacle it suddenly doesn’t seem to know how to turn.

Moving it to the basement solved these issues and it's now keeping the indoor outdoor carpet, bathroom, and tv room spotless. It was extremely easy to set up it's program start time and it generally runs for about ninety minutes before automatically returning to it's base to recharge. It has enough power to climb over thicker area rugs and so far it's programming has been up to the task of keeping it from getting stuck.

In my experience and according to tests (performed by others) against other robotic vacuums, the only way you’re going to (potentially) get better results is to spend thousands on one with LiDAR. With the exception of our living room, we don’t have carpet so most of my experience is on hard floors. Like any vacuum it has issues with cords, eliminating some areas of our home. My fav place to run it is in the master bedroom and connecting bath. I start the cycle using the edge option then switch it to whole room. I manually direct it under a couch and coffee table that are on carpet with excellent results. Regarding self docking: I don’t have the required 3 foot radius of clearance around the charging station, but it’s no big deal. I simply place the vac several inches in front of the charger and press the Home button on the remote and it docks itself just fine. Enjoy!",否,5,Denise,2022-11-03

US,B079QYYGF1,R1ZBUT8JIS7XOE,Amazing value for single level apartments,Color:Black,"My roommate and I were looking for a solution to dust accumulating on our hardwood floors in our new apartment. I had always had issues with the constant need to swiffer or mop to keep dust and dirt from sticking to my feet, and didn’t enjoy the idea of cleaning every other day.
<br>
<br>To both of our surprise, we’ve found ourselves incredibly thankful for this thing! We hardly ever have to clean our floor ourselves, except for the occasional mop.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- meets or exceeds its runtime on the smart boost mode
<br>- good balance of edge cleaning and random bounce around cleaning
<br>- IR sensors keep it from ramming full speed into everything
<br>- is able to clean my entire apartment within 1-2 runs
<br>- rarely gets lost on its way back
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- cords, cables, string, or other objects on the floor WILL trip this up and cause it to stop
<br>- it can be kinda loud and probably don’t want to have on during the day if you stay home (I ran mine at 3 am for a while)
<br>- can only run a single daily schedule, instead of being able to change it for each day of the week.

I mean really shoddy. One common problem with is withthe dustbin. The door on the dustbin falls of because it is a plastic knob and cup design. The knob and cup wear out quickly and the door begins to fall off. You can replace the door for twenty dollars if you want to wast time and money. To fix the problem you will need to replace the dustbin for forty dollars. Both from the Roomba website. The Eufy uses plastic hinges with a steel pin. The Eufy has a much better filter system that will trap dirt and dust. The Eufy filter system consists of three stages. For me the filter lasts about two weeks. The Roomba will redistribute the dirt. Think paper towel. The filter will last much longer because it doesn't trap much. Speed on the Eufy is variable but not on the Roomba. I think the Roomba has more suction because it has little filtration. This model of Eufy does not have a memory function but it does have a function for patterns.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3VW312W03D2XY,Important warning on this model,Color:Black,"This is my first robot vacuum so I did not know about the need for magnetic boundary strips. The 11S does not work with boundary strips!! Boundary strips are the only tool sold to block your vacuum from going to places full of cords or too tight and it gets stuck there. Because it can't use boundary strips-- and this is the official word from Eufy -- I am buying square wooden dowels and will glue and tape them together to make physical blocks. I don't know why they didn't put a magnetic sensor on this model or the 11 max.
<br>
<br>The vacuum does pick up a lot of dirt and fur and it's surprisingly fast.

<br>One thing I don't like about it is you have to get up close and personal with the filth every time you empty this bin. I hope there are other models for my future where it is easier and cleaner to empty the stuff out.",是,4,SandraA,2022-10-31

US,B079QYYGF1,R1EDRAGG6KENAW,"German Shepherd, Desert Dust and Wood Stove Mess Approved",Color:Black,"I went with the EUFY brand simply because of the high reviews and slim design. I also didn't want to have an app on my phone for a vacuum, mostly because the software seemed to be the biggest complaint. I've had my machine for about a week now and the dust of living in the southwest mountains is limited. The dog fur tumbleweeds from 2 German Shepherds are now gone and this also helps with the dust and dirt from a wood stove. Honestly I haven't even set up the remote yet, so I may fall more in love with this little machine in the future.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- It is easy to set up, plug in and turn on. (Again I haven't set up any official feature yet with the remote.)
<br>- It climbs over area rugs with ease or sometimes pushes them out of the way depending on the style
<br>- The dog fur and dust is now nearly gone.
<br>- It fits under the sofa and gets weird low edges under the counters, piano and end tables.
<br>- I no longer need to fight with my husband about who needs to vacuum anymore!!!
<br>- The filters are easy to clean.
<br>- The fur and hair is easy to clean out of the brush, especially since there are tools to help.
<br>- The dogs don't care about the vacuum like a large loud one. I expected to see one of the dogs riding it around or trying to kill it.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- This one doesn't have a dump station, so in a larger house you will need to dump the pan a few times during its rotation around the house.
<br>- I can see needing to purchase some extra filters and brushes.
<br>- There is no specific pattern that it follows and the machine seems to keep working on the same places over and over, but then again everything gets dusted and vacuumed.
<br>- The suction is lacking, but it picks up rocks and dirt with out any problem.
<br>-You have to empty it a bunch of times during its trip around the house.

On the second outing, with pet mat and water bowl out of harms way, it promptly wedged itself under a bookcase. After being nudged free, it returned and wedged itself in the exact same spot and wedged itself. Believe the manual when it says the vac can't deal with power cords. As a vacuum, it does ok. It tends to go over areas it has vacuumed repeatedly while other areas are steadfastly ignored. Maybe it will get around to them eventually. Maybe.

US,B07R295MLS,R3OQE6CQIIVBVF,Works great,Style:11S MAX,"Recently moved into a ranch style house with all laminate and ceramic flooring. Wasn't sure about using a robo vac but decided to try one after seeing reviews and a good price during the last Prime day. Product was well packaged and very easy to set up. The first thing was finding a place to set the base as you need a few feet around the base and the wife preferred it out of sight when not being used. Ended up in the bedroom. After using the vac about 6 times I was impressed with how much dirt and hair was picked up. We have a small dog. The unit is very quite and goes about it's business unattended ""if"" you plan ahead. The package comes with some cord ties and I used them to get most of the extensions and power cords out of the way. Initially I just hit the start button and let the unit do it's thing but I've since change that after a few cleanings. This is an entry level unit so it's cleaning pattern is random and I wanted to ensure each room was getting sufficiently cleaned. Personally I take the unit to a bedroom I want cleaned, pick up or move things out of the way, start the unit and shut the door. After awhile I'll come back and move it to the next room,etc. I feel this is a more efficient way of cleaning meanwhile I'm doing other things while the cleaning is in progress. As for the kitchen and great room area I just block off the hallway and let it meander around. I may break these up later using a temporary barrier. I have several carpets in these areas and have had no problems as the unit goes over them. There is a divider strip between the kitchen and great room and sometimes the unit would get hung up on it. My advice is to watch what the unit is doing in your house and than make adjustments as needed so you can be free to do other things when the unit is working without having to constantly check on. BTW: the unit does come with a remote control but we haven't used it yet. The unit will automatically return to the base for recharging but because of where we put it we just turn it of and put it back otherwise it was taking forever to find the base. So far we are really pleased with the quality and performance of this unit and using it as described has made cleaning less of a chore for us.",是,4,K. Plaskocinski,2022-10-19

US,B07R295MLS,R1A7X1Z7Q5AZMG,"Not the Smartest, but Impressive",Style:11S MAX,"Robot vacuums always seemed unnecessary to me. I figured, you'd still need a regular vacuum to get the corners and spots where the robot can't reach, so what's the point?
<br>
<br>Man, was I wrong.
<br>
<br>I don't think I realized how much we (4 kids under 11) lived with floating fuzzballs, bits of paper, and other random junk on the floor until we set this thing up on a schedule, and they just weren't there anymore. I can't remember the last product I bought that produced results that exceeded my expectations this much.
<br>
<br>But again, I've never had a robot vacuum before, so I might be saying the same about any make/model.
<br>
<br>Specific to this Eufy model, here are my thoughts:
<br>GOOD
<br>- Easy to get set up and use
<br>- General maintenance is all pretty easy
<br>- Suction power is impressive for something this size.
<br>- Not excessively loud
<br>NOT AS GOOD
<br>- You can set it to clean along the walls, travel in a growing spiral, or choose a random path. It doesn't have any spatial awareness (I think it's called LiDAR or something, and reserved for more expensive models), so it doesn't know what it's cleaned already, or what it hasn't cleaned. And it bumps into the same things (and gets stuck on the same things, if you don't move them) repeatedly.
<br>- The dust receptacle is smallish, but not terrible. It runs every day in our house, and needs to be emptied every 2 to 3 days.
<br>- Once it determines it's finished for the day, it seems to wander the house completely aimlessly, hoping it chances to come within a couple of feet or so of its charging base. I've seen it get really close, then turn the other way, continuing to search until it's completely out of batteries. Again with the spatial awareness.
<br>
<br>Overall, I'd 100% recommend this to a friend or someone just wanting to try out a robot vacuum. But I think when it comes time to replace it, so I'd probably upgrade to something a little smarter. But this guy definitely convinced me it's worth the investment.",否,4,Philip W.,2022-10-19

I was so excited to open this and begin playing with it. I felt like a little kid on Christmas! I use this thing everyday (not because my house is THAT dirty but because I'm obsessed with using it.) It does great for overall cleaning. By no means does it do a deep clean but I can feel my floors are not filled with little dirt specs or crumbs from wearing shoes in the house. I love that it goes under my couch and bed and it moves pretty well. My only issue is that my roommate has long hair and the brushes will get quickly filled with her hair (I KNOW, NASTY) so I have to frequently clean it. However, this thing has a great suction, fairly large catch for the dirt and moves well. I also like that if my wifi goes out, I can still use it.

<br>
<br>I wound up buying a $30 Bissell vacuum from Walmart that does a much better job and takes me all of 5 minutes. For $150 it does a pretty mediocre job, I'd say skip the purchase or invest in a better one if you really are wanting a robot vacuum.",是,3,Kim DeMartino,2022-10-18

It continued on its way and I let it run for an hour more. It never did clean up that area. I don't know much about how these are programmed and how they decide where to go, but I would have thought it would have remembered where it cleaned and didn't clean. The pattern is just so random that I'd have to let it run for hours before it got 99% of the floor. I saw it go over the same areas repeatedly and then not touch other areas. It just doesn't seem that smart.
<br>
<br>There are edge settings to get the perimeter of a room, room settings where it sticks to a single room, and circular patterns. I haven't used them. I'm not sure how furniture would interrupt those patterns. There's also a remote where you can manually direct it, but what's the point with a ""robot""?
<br>
<br>It does pick up the dust and dirt where it passes over, though. It's only been used on hardwood floors. I have seen it clean a small area rug at an entrance, so it can go from bare floor to rug. But again, it didn't completely do the rug. It was just a couple of passes.

<br>We also have a balcony and stairs. There is a 1/4"" trim piece around these areas. So far, it hasn't gone over, but it hangs over by a few inches before it pulls back. I don't trust it. There is a disclaimer in the instructions to block off areas like this as the sensor can get dusty and it may fall. To me, that's a show stopper. Why would you want to block off areas just to vacuum?

This is my first robotic vacuum and it has performed on par with expectations. Its daily cleaning has helped keep my home cleaner - and saved me time. Yeah, it bops along in a random pattern but it gets the job done to my satisfaction. In particular, have been impressed with how well the battery has held up - I have it scheduled to clean once a day and the battery still lasts 100 minutes - just as it did on day one.
<br>
<br>My only concern is that it is not as durable as I had hoped. It performed flawlessly for the first year, but as soon as I hit that 1 year mark (the end of the warranty) parts began to fail. Replacing worn parts on an inexpensive device doesn't bother me too much - but you need to remove lots of screws and awkwardly dismantle the entire unit to access one failed part. Thank God for several good youtube videos.
<br>
<br>In my case the brush roll motor failed first - again, immediately after the warranty period ended. It probably cost $25 and an hour of my time to replace. Now it needs one of the side brush motors replaced. I am at the point of making a decision - buy another Eufy 11s and keep my old one for parts or upgrade to another more ""durable"" / more easily accessed brand.

<br>Finally, would I recommend this unit? For someone like me - probably so. At only $129 it was a great introduction to robotic vacuums and I can still repair it and keep it going for a few years.

But it does leave some, but not much. They're great! Except.....Every time you run it you MUST take out the rotary sweeping wheel and pick off the pet hair and either vacuum out (read hand vac) or shake the dust out of the filter. Okay - but not great.
<br>
<br>But what really gets me is that about once a year (8-14 months) you get to buy another one because one of the wheels stops turning properly. It doesn't stop all together it just stops enough for the robovac to shut itself down.
<br>
<br>Then you have a choice. Either buy a new one or order a replacement motor. I have yet to go the buy a replacement motor route - it's the thinking, watching replacement videos and stuff that is too much for me. But like I said. I'm stupid.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2IDJWWONREMU,Eh. It's ok-ish,Color:Black,"I waited almost a year to write my review because I think it takes time to know if an appliance is worth it. This vacuum does pretty good at picking up the daily bits of crumbs and dirt that get on the floor. I did find dog hair in the canister so it picks that up too but not like a regular vacuum with a brush roll. This is not a smart vacuum so it just bumps around from room to room randomly. I knew that when I bought it and I will say it has a nice long battery life so if you can just let it go it will eventually get a whole room clean. The only issue there is you have to be anal about every cord picked up, no shoelaces or loose rug threads because it will suck them up and then you'll get an error code or wrecked cord. I think I spent almost as much time following the vacuum around to make sure it wasn't getting into trouble as I would have just cleaning the floor myself. The less complicated your room and floor, the better this thing will perform. My only real issue is that I keep having issues with a ""bumper stuck"" error code. When this happens the machine gets trapped rolling backwards in a 360 degree pattern until it stops and beeps. I've taken the thing apart and put it back together and sometimes that works. Sometimes tapping the bumpers frees them, sometimes it doesn't. The weirdest thing is that the bumpers aren't stuck, they move freely so there's nothing physical I can find to fix, which makes it more frustrating. If it's a sensor or computer issue, I can't do anything about that. I've probably only used it about a dozen times because of that issue and haven't used it at all in the last 3 to 4 months. It's not the worst vacuum in the world, but I wouldn't buy it again.",是,3,H Anderson,2022-10-03

US,B079QYYGF1,R1B189A0T70A01,Pleasantly surprised how well this works,Color:Black,"Recently got a Labrador puppy and it's impossible to keep up on the daily vacuuming. So purchased this to supplement weekly deep vacuuming with my Dyson.
<br>So far it works great. It’s not going to get everything, but it does a good enough job. I have it on a daily schedule which is handy. Were it is having issues is with loose cords under the beds (it recommends tying them up) and a slight transition from my hardwood floor to tile. Finally tied up the cords so I’ll see if that makes a difference (it should).
<br>I wish there was an app instead of the remote, but it’s not a deal breaker. If there was an app, I could be notified if the vacuum was stuck somewhere in my house. As it is now, I find it stuck under the bed a few hours after it started vacuuming and must start over. But for the price, it’s not a big deal.",是,5,EDR,2022-09-30

US,B079QYYGF1,R1BISFWIY61P6F,You didn’t know you were this dirty,Color:Black,"We LOVE Eufy. We have several. This purchase of Eufy was a gift for our daughter and family. They didn’t want one. I finally just gave them one despite the protestations. Three days later my daughter texts me: “Mom, I stand corrected. Eufy is awesome. How am I this dirty?” (Eufy picks up dirt you didn’t know you had! Even after vacuuming!) Two days later; random text from son-in-law: “Ok I’m definitely sold on eufy.” Grandkids now send me videos of Eufy doing her thing …good (zigzagging randomly along the floor, picking up dirt), or bad (yes, getting tangled in computer charging cords). She entertains, good with the bad. More importantly, she CLEANS, dog hair and all. You learn to get the cords out of her way ahead of time, and to block off areas where she gets repeatedly caught.
<br>My husband and I like this low end, no bells and whistles model the best (the 11S slim). We have the self-emptying, wifi-operated, programmable map-your-home models of other brands. Eufy CLEANS BETTER! Isn’t that why you bought her? Just set her loose; her random movements and 2 brushes (other brands have only one) cover and clean your entire space.

<br>It gets everything - including fine short cat fur, dust, cobwebs.
<br>Under the bed? Under the hutch? All clean.
<br>I find it easier to maintain than an upright. I can pick it up and set it in the counter, tap out the dust filters, rinse all the washable parts, dry and it's ready to charge and go again. With my upright it was a struggle to get into all the nooks and crannies that hold the dust, and washing it is just a huge hassle.
<br>My cat is unbothered by the sound and activity despite being a bit on the nervous side.
<br>I may use the upright for the beater for major-major cleanup, and the attachments for the stairs and corners of the ceiling but for the routine stuff, this thing is my guy.

We have had two Eufy 11s's for a few years now and take very good care of them. We recently bought an 11Smax and it worked great the first time we ran it. Later that day, I moved the new 11S to my daughters house where it continues to work just as expected for a week now.

Completely dead. The white one, which had new brushes and roller, ran but could only spin around in circles.
<br>
<br>Long story short, buying a new one appears to have killed TWO of our previous models. This is very upsetting that after having good luck with Eufy products, we were loyal to the brand, at a high cost.

We bought this three years ago and used it a couple of times a week. With two domestic shorthaired tuxedo cats, we have a lot of hair on our tile floors. You don’t see it till you bend over or sweep, but WOW, it’s there! Recently I started using my Robovac daily, dividing it up between the two parts of the house so that each part of the house was getting done every other day. It really helped keep the tile floors clean and I didn’t have to sweep nearly as much. Unfortunately it stopped working and after watching a few YouTube videos I realized I needed a new battery so I ordered that on Amazon. In the meantime I decided to do a deep cleaning because, up to this point, I was just cleaning out the filter and the cup. Everything else looked good and I didn’t even realize that hair was trapped inside the wheel compartments. With a small flat head screwdriver I was able to take everything apart and deep clean and as you can see from these pictures, it was disgusting. Anyway the reason it’s better than ever is I got the new battery, and with the deep cleaning I did it’s just like a new Robovac. One thing I learned is that I should probably be taking it apart once a year because there’s a lot of fur that gets in there that you just can’t see.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2EHYT6398574Q,I don't have pets -- so it does the job.,Color:Black,"So, I guess I'm pretty pleased with the Eufy 11S. It's just me and my wife - no pets or kids, so it cleans up the normal accumulating dust and dirt as I would expect it would.
<br>
<br>The auto settings are pretty good but I find I don't use them much. When set to ""auto"" I usually cancel it before it thinks it's finished because I'm satisfied with what its done, and it's kind of annoying that it goes back over the same spot several times...which I feel is redundant. If anything though, it's thorough!! Having the setting that just does edges &amp; corners is good, although it seems to operate solely on the ""right"" edge (a very conservative unit!! :-))
<br>
<br>I don't have a large house, so the Eufy never runs for terribly long when it's used -- therefore I don't always charge it after use. Lithium batteries last longer if they aren't charging all the time. I'll often push the ""home"" button, and then STOP it just before it reaches the base.
<br>
<br>Having the remote is handy, and being able to change the automatic cleaning path is great. The remote signal won't work around corners or through objects though.
<br>
<br>Sometimes I just want it to clean a small area at a time, so because it has no ""virtual walls"" I have to put up little barricades (or close a door) to keep it from going where I don't want it to. Sort of like putting a baby on the floor who's just learning to crawl! And of course --- you HAVE to pick up CORDS and anything else on the floor that the brushes and wheels might catch on to! Once it gets stuck -- it can't free itself. Small loose fitting rugs may also need to be moved. Rugs with rubber undersides are fine.
<br>
<br>The Eufy 11S is good because;
<br>- it's relatively quiet
<br>- battery is good
<br>- it cleans thoroughly
<br>- suction is very good
<br>- dirt bin is easy to empty
<br>- works on low to medium pile rugs as well as floors",是,4,RBW,2022-09-17

I am very happy with it especially when I compare it to the BobSweep I used to have. This unit does a fantastic job of getting up crumbs &amp; dust; I don't have any pets so hair is not an issue. I put it in my bedroom and closed the door so it could not come out. I left it in there for about 1/2 hour then, just out of curiosity, took a swiffer dry mop to the floor to see if any dust came up. I went under the bed and along the baseboard behind the bed. Wow I was so surprised! The swiffer pad was completely clean. I even had to show it to my husband and he was very impressed. The unit is also quiet enough that it doesn't annoy me like the BobSweep did. I would say the noise on this unit is equivilent to a reasonably quiet microwave. The remote is very easy to use &amp; it finds its docking station easily when I tell it to go home. One more aspect of this unit that I love is that it's not too tall - it doesn't get stuck under anything; at least not in my house.

US,B07R295MLS,R3JR55ZWFW9W83,Not ready for normal use,Style:11S MAX,"The engineering of this unit is not sufficient to keep it working in a normal house environment for more than a year. The roller brush will eventually pick something up during a cleaning cycle that will seize it. This will result in the failure of the roller brush 'transmission' unit which is ridiculously difficult to replace. The same thing will happen again, and again, and again. After the first failure I was offered a free replacement transmission (two gears with a belt between them) which I accepted and installed. The replacement lasted two months until something once again wound around the roller brush and stripped out the transmission. I cleaned the roller brush regularly to prevent this, to no avail. Installing a new transmission resulted in the same outcome several months later.
<br>Most of the highly-rated reviews of this vacuum are ‘initial experiences’. If you read some of the low-rating reviews they report the same experience I had – repetitive failures in a normal vacuum environment. The engineering strategy of this unit is poor at best.
<br>I purposefully bought a 'dumb' unit - I don't like the idea of someone storing a map of my house on their server. I expected the unit to vacuum erratically and randomly – which it did. I expected this unit to at least vacuum 'unintelligently' in a reliable no-breakdown fashion. It only had to vacuum one room and pick up dropped bird food.

It picked up a ton of additional dirt, dust and hair that my Bissell left behind.

My pets are terrified of the regular vacuum, but aren’t bothered by this one. The remote control makes vacuuming fun for my daughter. It’s like a video game that cleans house. It is very powerful so you need to make sure no items are on the floor because it will drive over them.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2LIXHBOKU6B4O,"Good Daily Sweeper, But Kinda Dumb...",Color:Black,"We named ours E-Bot, and he trundles around the house sucking up dust, hair, and crumbs, and all too often cables, papers, and clothing.
<br>
<br>Cleaning Power: 3/5
<br>The robot works like a broom most of the time, and given a perfectly flat floor in a rectangular room, he will suck up just about anything, but in the real world, it struggles to actually pick up dust and hair.
<br>Running once a day keeps the floors acceptably clean, though. We empty his cartridge once every other day for a 900sf cleaning area.
<br>
<br>Mapping, Object Avoidance, Navigation: 3/5
<br>This is where our E-Bot struggles. We rescue him at least twice during his sweep cycles when he runs up onto something that didn't have enough reflectivity to redirect his IR sensors, but also wasn't quite high enough to press on his front bumper to get him to turn.
<br>Any kind of string, cable, bag straps, or lightweight clothing gets immediately wrapped around the side or main brushes and brings him to a beeping halt.
<br>When he's in a perfectly clean environment, he does okay at not getting stuck, but often re-cleans the same areas and ignores others.
<br>He is very all-terrain, and frequently astounds us with how stuck he can get.
<br>
<br>Features: 4/5
<br>This is where Eufy packed a lot of value into the vacuum. The auto-schedule run time is awesome, and being able to send him home to the charge station at the push of a remote button is super handy! E-bot has several clean styles, and a few different suction/noise settings that run off of some sort of detector when set to ""BoostIQ mode,"" which lets the vacuum impeller ""suck"" harder in short bursts to clean up heavy messes.
<br>E-Bot lacks a ""canister full"" alert, and will keep trying to clean even when jammed full of hair and dirt, so you have to manually check and empty the canister every other day or so. The ""edge"" sensors don't seem to work well either, and I wouldn't recommend using it at the top of stairs or significant drops.
<br>
<br>Overall, not nearly as good as a name brand Roomba, but definitely a decent cleaning bot for 1/3rd the price!
<br>Our E-bot keeps our floors clean, and despite the drawbacks, he's been a great little robot!",是,4,Noah,2022-09-05

It was close to the coffee table, but there were no obstacles in front of it. We pressed the button on the vacuum's surface, and the brushes rotated once, and it stopped and beeped again. We picked up the vacuum, checked if something had obstructed the roller brush, and placed it a few steps further, and nothing; not even with the remote. After several tries, it resumed cleaning. It stopped and did the same thing again several minutes after. The second time, it ran over the docking station; we also noticed that battery didn't last longer than an hour. We don't feel confident leaving it running unsupervised, so it doesn't work like we'd hoped.",是,3,Elizabeth Santiago,2022-09-05

Almost instantly I was off put but it’s random cleaning pattern. It went back and fourth over the same path 10 times before changing direction. To me that’s a huge battery suck! It also did an okay job of cleaning the pet hair, unless it went over the same exact spot more than three times.
<br> Since it doesn’t know where it’s going and where it’s already been..if it has to go back and recharge, it won’t continue where it left off..it just has to start the cycle all over again. Another con is that it doesn’t work with the magnetic boundary strips, so if there’s furniture you don’t want it to go under you have to physically put something to block it. Personally I don’t feel like placing objects down on my floors every time I want it to clean.
<br>
<br>Two pros I will say is that it’s quiet and has a small enough profile it will fit under most furniture. But that’s all..

This has the weirdest “dust cup” it doesn’t allow anything but tiny particles to be sucked up. Hair is too big to go in, so it jams up the brush. It’s more a duster than a vacuum.

Listennn y’all don’t know me so I’m gonna really tell you what it do! I have worked for years to not be so messy. I have failed over and over. I don’t have good habits! I leave things laying around! I would sweep maybe three times a year. But THIS ROBOT was the BIGGEST milestone in my cleaning journey. My floors now stay clean ! I pick things up now! because I adore the kindness of this robot. And I love not wearing shoes and not having to compromise with dusty feet. Dusty feet are a thing of the past. Honestly a robot can only be so smart though it’s still pretty smart! But it might get suck everyday in the same spot so you might have to accommodate to it in minor ways by moving something differently or taping a cord down but it’s beyond worth it for me. It has genuinely improved my everyday life, it takes one more thing off my plate, I have real appreciation for it. I recommend this specific robot vac, specifically because I think too much about agreeing to those “terms and conditions” that you consent to when another vacuum forces you to have an app on your phone to be able to control the vacuum you could possibly be giving them access to your phone information and maybe even third party’s could have access to an accurate exact map of your house. I recommend everyone actually reads the terms and conditions especially the privacy policy section of any legal document you chose to agree with. But I can’t say a negative thing about this vacuum it is beautiful, MUCH less noisy than a regular vacuum, the volume is comparable with an average microwave turned on and running. Also the price compared to leading regular vacuums this is easier to use than a regular vacuum AND cheaper. I will say it is by far the best investment I have ever made. Also probably worth mentioning you should avoid letting it suck up any water at all butttt all my three dogs throw some water while drinking, I don’t always get the chance to wipe it up before the robot vac makes it there it has inhaled water more than once and it doesn’t seem to be fazed. Oh and I do have to change the dirt tray often at least once a day and I have a very small house but like I said .. SO WORTH IT!

Overall, I am happy with it. It does a great job cleaning and gets under furniture. However, it can not run unsupervised.

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with wood floors (no rugs), a bird whose downy feathers and food bits end up on the floor, and a landscaper who tracks in little bits of mulch and plans debris.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2HG9G3UZNK5HK,Very Happy. Super Easy setup. Works great,Color:Black,"I had never heard of this brand/company before but bought this Eufy 11s after seeing excellent Consumer Reports ratings/review and the much more reasonable price in comparison to other RoboVacs. It is a basic model, it starts itself, does a great job vacuuming, short profile (2.85 inches high)so it gets under most furniture without getting stuck and returns itself to the charger. The least I can do is empty it each day and I have no need to track it on my phone. We have 2 long haired, constantly shedding cats and a never-ending supply of grass dirt and debris that is tracked into our rural house. The vacuum does a great job and certainly gets to it far more often than I otherwise would. I appreciate that I don't have to buy bags for it and that the ""micro-screen"" and foam filters can both be gently washed, dried and replaced. It also has a corrugated paper behind the other two filters. The 2 rotating brushes get into the edges.
<br>The vacuum is very quiet, you could sleep, use the phone or watch TV in the same room without a problem. I have it set to start vacuuming at 10:30PM each night, which is a good reminder to start heading for bed. If desired, you can also run the vacuum anytime just by pressing the start button on the vacuum.
<br>The vacuum does seem to drive in a very random pattern (which Consumer Reports did comment on) but by the time it is done, it has gotten everywhere. And while it can be intriguing to watch sometimes, I have better things to do than worry about exactly which path the vacuum took to get the job done.
<br>I have to admit that it took me a few weeks to start using Eufy 11s. I thought I needed time to set it up and to do a final hand vacuuming before letting it go ...but did set up the base and started the unit charging so it could be ready when I had time to do all that. It was my 2 year old inquisitive grandson that unwittingly showed me differently. He wandered in and pushed the button and Eufy started vacuuming. Once I pulled out the instructions to set up the remote, I realized how super easy it is. I am sure there are probably more features, but all you really need to do is to install the provided batteries into the remote, set the clock and set a remote vacuum time! Bingo...2 minutes tops!
<br>My Eufy 11s has been running for 2 months and I am still as happy with it as day 1 and have now bought a second Eufy vacuum as a birthday gift",是,5,Grin10Xs,2022-08-27

I read a lot of the reviews and honestly don't know how this got such high reviews. Yes, it vacuums well but it has ZERO navigation! It would bump into things, circle around and continue in the same room before it came out and did a couple of passes in another room but then go back to the same room without ever fully cleaning it. Its ""navigation pattern"" makes no sense and unless you see it for yourself its hard to explain. Not worth the money.

I have fully troubleshooted the issue according to the manual and it persists. What happens is that the Vacuum will start and then it will stop, blink red, and beep three times which indicates the drop sensors are dirty. However, they are NOT dirty. I take impeccable care of my vacuum because I legitimately loved it. I do everything the trouble shooting recommends and the vacuum does not work. Moreover, customer service insists that any refund will be prorated the use of the vacuum so it will not be made in full. (I am contesting this, as this is not only a breach of an express warranty but also implied warranties.) Further, if I allowed them to replace my product, they would not reinstate the warranty, instead they argue the warranty would extend only from the original date of purchase. This is also contestable as a breach of implied warranty. This company knows their product is faulty and has put illegal policies in place to mitigate their bottom line.

US,B07R295MLS,RSQJEN8G4I0P5,Some issues with functionality.,Style:11S MAX,"This vacuum does a pretty decent job of cleaning and picks up a great deal of hair and dirt. We have two dogs, and it did a great job picking up dog hair- at least where it actually vacuumed. For some reason though, it simply could not find the dock, and never indicated when the receptacle was full. It would just continue, leaving a trail of dog hair behind we had to go back and clean up. It wasn't able to effectively map our home, so basically vacuumed the same rooms two or three times, missing all the rest. Those rooms were really clean though!
<br>The suction is great, but the receptacle fills up really quickly, so if you have animals, you'll have to empty it multiple times every cycle - it really needs to be larger. For an average cycle, it had to be emptied about 4 times, even if we ran it everyday. As well, we live in a desert climate, so it's very dusty and unfortunately, the filter clogs with every cycle as well.

US,B079QYYGF1,RB8OSCXIOMC96,Doesn’t live up to the hype,Color:Black,"I was really excited about this vacuum and it has been disappointing. I have all wood floors so I’m constantly having to sweep and vacuum. The main problem I have is that it doesn’t clean the entire floor when on “auto” function. It will clean the areas it goes over but doesn’t follow any particular pattern/routine, so some areas are vacuumed while other areas don’t get cleaned at all. I will literally end up using the remote control arrows to guide it over specific spots it has missed…so I basically end up following it around, directing it, which defeats the purpose. The other big complaint I have is that it bangs into any furniture with legs (ex. Mid century modern) and leaves marks (see pic). I can’t turn it on and leave the house because it gets stuck on so many things and can’t reset itself (ex. thresholds of doorway). And I’m surprised by some reviews that say it is quiet because I find it kind of loud, a little lower than a regular vacuum but Definitely noticeable. I will say that the “edging” option has been good for cleaning along the baseboards and corners.",是,2,mg,2022-08-21

I saw this vacuum on Prime Day for a great deal and decided to pull the trigger and see what it would pick up. Really cost-effective for my teacher’s salary and a good deal so I knew I was getting my money’s worth. I’m so busy I never have time to clean properly so I got Francis and set him to work. His first time out of the gate he picked up SO MUCH HAIR. Like, I needed to get out the little comb tool to clean it out so much. For the first week his dust trap filled up every day, at least once. He hits all of my rooms 2beds, a bath, living room, and kitchen on a 90-ish minute charge, I have him set to clean once daily so he’s mostly ‘asleep’ during the day, but adjusting the schedule is super easy and I can set him to cleaning with the press of a button.
<br>The biggest issue I have is him getting into things I leave on the floor- he doesn’t pick up anything larger than dust and hair, no pennies or receipts or things like that that occasionally end up on the floors. It doesn’t seem like a problem, but he kicks up a big fuss when he can’t eat whatever it is and everyone can hear it. He’s generally pretty quiet, I don’t usually have to adjust the tv sound or anything. The loudest thing is when he bumps into a cabinet or something and has to navigate away from it.

<br>The first time we used it on our wooden, dog hair(Pretzel the Chihuahua) strewn floor (despite vacuuming 3 times a day) we were astonished and embarrassed how shiny the floor became after just 30 minutes. The floor we'd thought was clean(ish) had been swept of enough dog hair to fill the can.
<br>After a few days of following it around, seeing it slide under furniture, bump along edges, reach into corners and refuse to fall down stairs, we allowed it free reign on wood, carpets, tiles and rugs, only occasionally answering a plea for help as it tried to ingest power cords we'd forgotten to raise above floor level.
<br>Though not particularly smart (it's rare for any surface to be covered less than 3 times), it nevertheless clears a large area well within its battery life. Usually after about 45 minutes we take pity on its now fruitless search and send it home. It meanders around the room one last time as if admiring its work, until at last redocking, recharging as it sleeps.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2GPYH01P3AQZM,Not recommended for Oriental carpets,Color:Black,"Having recently rescued a second kitten, I decided to try a robotic vacuum cleaner to help with the shedding on my Oriental carpets. The directions said to tuck all the fringe under the carpet so vacuum won't get stuck on the fringe. What a job! Sounds easy, but isn't in practice. Takes longer to tuck the fringe than to vacuum with a regular vacuum. I can see how this little guy would be great for area carpets that aren't fringed like Oriental carpets are but definitely not worth the trouble for those of us who do have them. On the plus side, it was easy to set up and charge and I think would be great in most houses - just not houses like mine with fringed carpets in every room.",是,1,S. Jones,2022-08-11

We ran our Eufy daily for the first year and it did great picking up the smaller stuff and most of the hair. Sure, we had to empty it and remove built up human and dog hair every few days, but that’s far less annoying than vacuuming ourselves daily.

<br>
<br>About two weeks ago it started acting up, and after a bit of back and forth with the customer service to check diagnostics, they replaced it under the warranty. If I lived close to my parents, I actually think I could have replaced the brush motor (which they suspected needed to be replaced) but they said if that would be too difficult they would simply replace the unit. So we went with that.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1UTO1O8JYP8SG,Pretty Good for My Perfect Use Case,Color:Black,"As a disclaimer, I have essentially the perfect use case for a robot vacuum. I live in a medium-size studio apartment with light-colored floors, no carpets, no throw rugs, and no pets.
<br>
<br>I have a dust mite allergy, and after living in my apartment for 8 months or so I started sneezing a bunch from dust that accumulated under hard to move things like my bed and under shelves. I’m not very large or strong so it would have been incredibly difficult to move my furniture every time I needed to vacuum under there.
<br>
<br>I decided to throw money at the problem and try out a robot vacuum. And it worked incredibly well! I had to empty the dust trap twice the first time it cleaned under my bed (ew). It was unable to pick up a two-golfball sized dust bunny but I was able to use the manual mode to push it out to me so I could grab it myself. As a side note the manual mode is super useful for getting things out from under places, but I’m sure that that would be considered off-label use.
<br>
<br>So far I’ve run it 3 times and I’m super happy with it so far. It only got stuck a couple of times, and it was totally my fault for leaving that stuff out.
<br>
<br>The only downside is that if you have long hair and run it infrequently (e.g. once per week) you’ll be cleaning hair out of all of the brushes every time you run it. SO MUCH HAIR gets tangled in the brushes. I would imagine that if you have pets you’d have to run it at least 2-3x per week and may even have to clean the brushes out mid-run. If you live in a house with multiple women with long hair, you may also want to run it more frequently and clean the brushes after out each time.
<br>
<br>On that note, I saw a review by someone saying that the brushes break a lot, and I would guess that cleaning the brushes out more often could help prevent that. A large quantity of long hair wrapped tightly around it would put a decent amount of stress on it and could cause it to break over time.
<br>
<br>I’m also pretty happy with the pathfinding. Yeah it bumps into stuff a lot, but that’s literally what it’s supposed to do. It DOES NOT map your house, and if you want that you should probably be prepared to shell out way more than $130 for it. I’ll be happy if it lasts 18 months or so, because at that price point it would be unreasonable to expect it to last years and years.
<br>
<br>I’ve only had it for 3 weeks so far though so I’ll update this review if it breaks a month from now or something.",是,5,Amazon Customer,2022-08-07
US,B07R295MLS,R2Q03P5QTZ0CBZ,Better than name brand,Color:Black,"We love this robot. We use it on a daily basis. Our previous two name brand robots would get caught on things, get ""lost,"" and fill up quickly. We also had to replace parts on them often and clean them out quite a bit. This one rarely gets stuck, always makes it home, and we LOVE the remote control. There's no app for it, but that doesn't matter to us. You can use the included remote to schedule it, but best of all are the variety of options. You can AIM it towards a particular spot while it's running and then it will just keep going after it gets the spot done. It has an edging option, where it will just follow the edges of the room. You can also adjust its suction power, or just let it run on auto. We've had this for about a year, and are still happy. Even if it breaks down on us in a year, it will have at least matched the life of our previous name brand robots.

I can’t believe how helpful it is! I use it every day and love it’s spill circle function for cleaning up cereal or kid crumbs on the floor. I’ve accidentally opened the canister too soon before going to the location where I dump it out and I just put the little robot to clean up all the dirt. I got a second one for my mom during prime days for a really low price! She can’t believe how life changing it is for her. She has two long hair cats and watches her grand kids. She has it run at 4am and she says she loves waking up to a very clean house. We hardly ever have to pick up our brooms anymore. If there’s a broom job I just place the robot there put it in spirit mode and viola! All done! I’ve been very happy. I have never owned a robot vacuum and probably never would have because of their price but this little guy is totally worth it’s bargain price!

US,B07R295MLS,R3USX4LT9VYM2E,I never though that we would need this product.,Color:Black,"My wife was ""convinced"" that we could use a robot vacuum cleaner. So she gave me the task of finding a good one but not too expensive. I finally chose the ""Eufy by Anker, BoostIQ RoboVac 11S MAX, Robot Vacuum Cleaner, Super-Thin, 2000Pa"" product. Since it was ""for"" the wife, she finally got around to working out the control system. If there was a problem originally that was the biggest one. She now uses it pretty much every day. We have four wirehaired kinds of dogs &amp; they shed a bit &amp; two cats who also shed. This product seems to take care of the majority of that problem.
<br>The other problems are that it doesn't get into the ""nooks &amp; crannies"" of areas so we do have to follow up each week by vacuuming those with a vacuum cleaner. She does put the chairs up on the dining room table &amp; picks up dog blankets &amp; dog stairs &amp; toys, etc, but still there are spots that can't be vacuumed with this product. The other problem is that when the battery does run down eventually. sometimes getting it back to it's recharging station isn't as easy as it's supposed to be. But these are minor problems &amp; were expected. The nice thing imo, was that was a return policy. Our first one broke within 6 months, (&amp; we hadn't even used it the first month &amp; a half), &amp; there was no quibbling. We called &amp; they just sent us a second vacuum. My wife cleans out the little dust bin on a daily basis, but she doesn't mess with changing out the cleaning wipers once they wear down, or when the battery doesn't keep a charge for long. Once these items go bad, (if it's been a year or so), she'll just go get another one. I do wish that they made one where the battery lasted for more than a year or so.

Make sure you do not have any cords around because it will start to get tangled. Also do not have any wet spots because then the filter gets wet and does not pick up enough. Clean it frequently because it picks up every dust particle. You will be surprised how much your broom misses. Keep it on the charger otherwise it will slowly lose battery. It can get stuck at times on deep levels between a room but it usually will figure it out because it has so many different roller balls on the bottom. It’s pretty sensitive but not a lot so it can knock into things but other times if it’s a large item it will sense it and go around. Carpet is great it can easily transition from hardwood to tile to carpet, as long as the carpet isn’t too loose then sometimes it will start to fold the corners and try to bulldoze over it.

US,B079QYYGF1,RXC8P36UNDSMZ,BEST DOG EVER!,Color:Black,"For us, getting a robot vacuum was a really big deal. we saved our pennies, hemmed, hawwed, then eventually waited until just the right moment and got ourselves what we thought was going to be the dumbest smart vacuum we could find. no wifi. no mapping our house and sending that information across the internet, just something to bounce off the walls and get the floor clean.
<br>
<br>As it turns out three years on, we were in fact buying ourselves a robo-dog that desheds around the house. we love eufy and after only a couple of days we understood why people said they pronounce it ""oof-ie"". eufy gets all excited when you are home and follows you around the house. she wants to be right where you are. she will bump into your feet and try to get your attention, then when you walk away and try to get some space she will follow you to the next room. we are pretty sure she misses us when we aren't around. The awesome part is she doesn't beg for treats. she just wants you to pay attention, brush her roller out and clean up her back side every couple of days. Because she doesn't seem to see very well, she doesn't always get everything every day, but over the course of a few days the apartment was looking so nice. eufy is one hungry little bugger. she has been pretty consistent, but she does want to be pampered with filters and brushes from time to time. what pet doesn't need a new collar or toy every so often though? Eufy does have a silly playful streak. she will try to hide under the bureau or get herself tied up in wires. you really have to be a good pet owner and eufy-proof the house to keep her out of trouble. it is worth it, though. just remember that eufy-proofing can be a regular chore where you have to keep your space safe and maintained. Eufy will thank you for it...
<br>
<br>now, if you take a good look at eufy in the picture, you will see she has a bandage on her back. One day my girlfriend picked eufy up to rub her belly and make sure her back side was clean, and she accidentally fell! we were terrified and heartbroken all at the same time. it turns out, she was all slick and pretty because she had a glass back. We love eufy too much for her to be in that kind of pain, so we stitched her up and my girlfriend decoupaged the most awesomest bandage ever on to her back so she wouldn't be sad. nobody wants to see eufy sad.
<br>
<br>At this point we love eufy so much we are getting her a new little sister, the 11 s max. not quite a twin, but they really do look alike. soooo cute. eufy is going to go upstairs so her sister can be a puppy downstairs with us and the birds and so she can play with the other dog and the cat.",是,5,slick,2022-08-03

It's been about 2 weeks and it seems to still be learning the layout. It easily goes from carpet to hardwood floors and rolls over throw rugs and most cords. Once is a while it gets stuck and has to be picked up and moved but not very often. I probably wouldn't let it run if I wasn't home.

US,B079QYYGF1,RT7TU8ZZ3C2P5,Prepared to be humbled,Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.     &nbsp;Man, I never thought I could love an inanimate object so much, but this guy takes the cake. Small, cute, compact. I have never owned a robot vacuum before but having 2 short-haired, mild-shedding dogs, I wanted some ""extra"" help around the house. I thought I was on top of the constant dog hair tumbleweeds making way through my home. I thought my floors were pretty clean. I boasted about vacuuming every day, if not everyday with both a central vac for deeper cleans and a wireless for a quick touch-up. But when I opened up the dirt-catcher, I was taken aback and a little humiliated by the amass of dust and dog hair after I had just vacuumed the day before. Eufy didn't brag or give any smug looks as he continued to pick up on my slack. Which he has done twice a day since just getting him a short 24 hours ago. I think I have emptied the compartment about 6 times, not because his dirt-catcher is too small, but the amount of debris he picks up is substantial. The way he meticulously wiggles and uses his brushes to get the edges is super satisfying to watch. I have only had him working on my hardwood floors with a few area carpets. He transitions between each flooring type with ease utilizing the boost IQ feature which provides higher suction on carpeted areas. My hardwoods are noticeably cleaner for the eyes and for the soul. My area carpets still have some noticeable dog hairs ingrained deep when given a closer look. But unless your guests are sitting on the floor, it looks clean. He follows an unpredictable zig zag pattern which makes him cover almost all of the floor areas. On his first trek, I watched as he would pass by lines of dirt and thought my floors would be splotchy. Again, he proves me wrong and continued on his way to get every area. He never got stuck and manages to wiggle his way in and out of tight areas. I let him charge up for a few hours and he will work tirelessly for about an hour and a half before finding his way back to home base. The dogs have learned to let him be and retreat to their dog bed as he does his thing throughout the house. The fiance is also weary of a robotic mechanism lurking throughout the house, hearing him thump down our brick-like tiled hallway. But, seeing how much joy this genius robot brings me as I excitedly show off the full dirt catcher compartment has subsided all their hesitations. I have yet to use any timing features and only run him as needed. But the remote buttons seem pretty straight forward. The noise level is a slight hum when he is in another room, loud hum when nearby, but not too much so that you can't enjoy watching TV or having a phone conversation. I'm hoping by tomorrow, he will have my hard floor surfaces at bay and he can start working on my low-rise bedroom carpets. Thanks Eufy for humbling me, making my floors look noticeably cleaner, tormenting the dogs and fiance to my amusement and making my home more cleansing for the soul.",是,5,Shellys423,2022-07-31

Once you find and block/resolve all of the issues, she can run independently on a schedule. She cleans under furniture that she can fit under very well. The first couple times I used her, the dust bin was super full and I probably should have emptied it midway through the cleaning (but I hadn’t vacuumed in a long time).

I was very pleased that it went under all my furniture in every room except the sofa. I very rarely just let it roam to clean, I use the remote control to direct it. I have a cat and find it does a fantastic job with hair and dander. I can complete 6 rooms without running out of a charge or having to empty it which is very simple. It gave me peace of mind that things were staying clean and my husband didn't acquire another job while trying to take care of me. Highly recommend.",否,5,Amayzd,2022-07-27
US,B079QYYGF1,R1BUPNCHJS705C,I am pleasantly surprised,Color:Black,"I am pleasantly surprised with this robot vacuum. I had high expectations based on so many good reviews, but after seeing it in action making random turns without any logic, I was very skeptical. This little vacuum is slim enough to get under my couches and beds which is a huge plus for me. However, lack of logic and ability to check where it went through (there is no app for it), makes me question if it covers entire area.
<br>My house is over 3000 sq, one story, with the mix of tile and laminate floors with only one room with carpet (where I can clearly see traces and also can tell area was not 100% covered). Ling hair are getting rolled over the rotating brush.
<br>On the first run vacuum never made it to the base either. But made it in the later runs.
<br>I was not happy as you can sense from my review, but when I opened trash compartment I was shocked! It was full of dust. Wow! Thinking it all came from areas I cannot access with my dyson, it well worth it to have this robot vacuum! For slightly over $100 it's the best deal on the market.

It seems to move around the room in a random way but seems to get everything except what is within 2 feet of the home base. For some reason it avoids the area around the home base. It is very good at parking itself for charging. The filter/screen seems to be very good at collecting dust on its surface that can be easily brushed off.

US,B07R295MLS,R1MQPWF1FLYZZN,Great budget friendly automatic vacuum,Color:Black,"My expectations were low as this model didn't cost much, but it has great things going for it.
<br>
<br>You can program the time it starts; it has enough suction and brushes that it really does help keep the doggo fur tumbleweeds picked up; it's not very loud; has a decent sensor to prevent lots of bumping into things; it's thin enough to get under couches and easy chairs; it comes with plenty of spare filters and brushes and the cleaning tool is actually helpful; the directions are easy to read; and it's easy to open up everything to empty dust bin and clean wheels.
<br>
<br>The only two negatives, and i hate to call them negatives, are that you can't program the route it takes. it just kinda does it's own thing so sometimes it gets stuck in awkward places like between the treadmill and the wall in the den. but a well placed pillow running from the back of the couch to the wall keeps it out. And it gets stuck horking on cords (and dog toys) till it runs out of battery. the zip ties they send....use them. the suction is good enough that it won't let go of cables (and dog toys) to return to base. we actually ordered velcro cable wraps for ease of use if you add to or subtract a cable from the bundle.
<br>

My cats are frightened of it, but I have a neighbor who says they get used to it with time. I forgot to clean it for a few days in a row and it put out a forlorn beep and stopped, butI gave it a cleaning and it was back doing its job. It didn't go off the stairs, but then again it just stopped and didn't back up. That is probably better. It also got stuck in my bathroom, just going round and round bouncing off walls and stuff - very clean in there but I shut the door now. I suppose small spaces might confuse it. It gets under my sofa which is nice. In terms of vacuum power, It is not a Kirby by any means, but a daily light vacuum is probably just as good if not better. since it won't pull up fibers or damage rugs with too much suction. It had trouble finding its way back onto the stand yesterday, - it mounted the stand and looked like it was beginning to charge, but then beeped , backed up and gave it another try. It kept doing this until I picked it up and put it down about two feet from the charger. It went through one more false park and then returned OK. I am quite happy with it.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3TPUW5VIX2TPC,Worth the money!,Color:Black,"I got this machine to clean up the cat and dog hair mostly, but am pleasantly surprised at the dirt, cat litter and small items it picks up, as well. We have 2 short-haired cats and 1 short- haired dog, and I no longer have to sweep every day! I just run the Eufy and it does the work for me. Please know that this machine does not function like a high end machine in efficiency, but it is very effective in doing what I need it to do. It does not map the house like the high end machines, and it does not go in a back and forth motion, as in rows. It runs in a very random pattern, but I just let it go and do what it can do, and I am satisfied with the results. Over the course of a run, it pretty much gets most of the hardwood floor clean, as well as low pile rugs. I have used the boost function and am happy with those results when I had a little bigger mess to clean. The home function has only worked once for me. Usually, I just turn it off and put it back on the charger. I have to empty and clean the brush after each use, anyway, so that hasn’t been a problem for me. I have not used any of the other functions.
<br>
<br>A few tips: I do run it when I am home during the day, not while I am away from the house or at night. That way I can keep an eye on it and take care of any issues that may arise. It has gotten caught on a rug that was a little torn and tangled in a cord I forgot to move, but I was there to rescue it. Those were my fault. I also don’t want a cat’s tail to get caught in it. I do keep the remote handy and guide it if I feel like it is missing a spot.
<br>
<br>Overall, I am super pleased and feel I got my money’s worth. I purchased on Amazon Prime Day, but the actual price of $135 today is still worth it. I can’t speak to longevity yet, but It certainly checked the boxes of what I needed. I do not miss sweeping the downstairs everyday!

US,B079QYYGF1,R103HT8S0JTEN4,Affordable and effective,Color:Black,"I have wanted a robot vacuum for so long but couldn’t make myself spend hundreds on one but when I found this for a much more affordable price, I had to try it. I do have a small mini Aussie who does shed quite a bit for a smaller dog, plus I live in west TX where it’s very windy and dusty. I’d say this does so well with picking up dirt and hair. I love all the different settings on the vacuum. I’m not sure how it compares to other robot vacuums but it does an alright job at reading the room/a it’s vacuuming. I love that you can set it to go around the edges everywhere and then to go over the whole surface area as well. The timer option is also great because I can set that and it’ll go off at the same time everyday to vacuum.
<br>The dirt container is small as it’s a small vacuum so I would say if you have a very dirty house, you should check that often and definitely empty after every major vacuum and make sure to dust the filter area and clean out any debris from the rotary wheel area.
<br>You should also make sure there’s nothing on the floors to get the vacuum caught in, like clothing. It’ll suck that up and then shut off.

Firstly, I got this model specifically because of one of the funniest reviews I’ve ever read. I’ve wanted a robo vacuum for years and we could never really justify getting one until recently. I have a dog and a cat that shed profusely. I’m talking our carpets went from white to black in a week and no amount of brushing could save us. We were vacuuming each room in our 2 story house twice each cleaning day and we had those twice a week. I got the eufy 11s with hopes of cutting down on our vacuuming at least a bit and holy crap I will never buy another vacuum. Our floors have never been so clean! One 80 minute pass of the downstairs every day has made our floors so soft and comfy again! No more fur everywhere! It got under all the furniture and our dog can finally relax under the bed again! It’s also a great playmate for both pets. They love watching over rotom (yes we named it) and following it around. It does get stuck often and bumbles around with no real sense of direction but I love it that way. It gets itself out of a jam 9/10 times and returns to its home without any prompting from us! I’ve left it on while doing chores or even going to work and it just happily munches on dust and fur until it’s time for a nap. I will say we have to clean the filter more often than the suggested twice per week but I don’t mind! Just a quick rinse and drying in the sun then it pops back in! The one issue we’ve had is that the spinning side brushes won’t stay on at all. It’s a huge game changer when it comes to cleaning!

US,B079QYYGF1,RE7E0FU69GOAO,Really gets up the dirt and hair!,Color:Black,"This is my first time using a Eufy. I have used a robot vacuum for approximately 15 years and I've owned two Roombas and a Shark. My old Roomba was wearing out so I took the opportunity during Prime Day to get a new one but this time wanted a lower profile machine. While charging the new Eufy I ran the old Roomba one last time, then I ran the Eufy to see how much more dirt it would get. It was amazing how much! Granted the old Roomba was old and worn out but the Eufy picked up so much additional dirt and hair that the bin filled up before the battery ran out. It's significantly quieter and with the lower profile it gets under some furniture that the old Roomba couldn't. When it can't go under something, it gently bumps it instead of slamming into it like the Roombas tend to do. I'm hoping there will be much less damage to my furniture. The bin is easy to remove and clean, the battery time is very long although I haven't timed it so I can't say how long. The only negative so far is that it doesn't work with electronic barriers so you can block off areas; you have to put up physical barriers.

Furthermore, as far as I know, I have no affiliation whatsoever with anyone who might have made a single dime by my having done so. I am simply a paying consumer who will write an honest product review every now and then in case it helps someone, usually for the items I liked the most... Just sayin'.***
<br>
<br>Keeping in mind that it is probably one of the cheapest and dumbest robovacs you can get, it works great. It is especially good at getting all the edges and nooks and crannies. Over the course of a run cycle, it will usually get just about every inch of floor. It will certainly get every inch of floor every few cycles, so just run it often if a missed spot here or there bothers you.
<br>
<br>We love the simplicity of it. It has a simple remote, so you can tell it when to start, stop, turn a certain way, suck harder, return to the base, or or whatever. There is even a mode that lets it decide for itself when to suck normally and save battery, or suck harder to get a rug or whatever. One of our favorite buttons sends it on a mission to get all the edges in the area. This is especially fascinating to watch as it is quite capable of snooping them all out and thoroughly cleaning them. I would even say it excels at this. It even gets under the furniture, and who knows what might be lurking there. All you will ever need to do with this robovac in the house is get the narrow spaces between furniture or whatever that is too small for the robot to access. I have a small cordless vac with an edge attachment for this.
<br>
<br>We have all hardwood floors and just leave it in standard mode and get longer run times. We think it might even have a function that starts it automatically when you decide, but we haven't tested this and really don't think it is something we would ever need. We are very low tech people, and certainly didn't want to pay for a bunch of features we might never even learn how to use. There is definitely a picture of a clock on one of the buttons on the remote though, so we figure it must be for setting a schedule to run it automatically.
<br>
<br>It is super quiet too, so we don't mind running it when we are here to watch. It is sort of entertaining. Though we certainly also trust it to do its thing if we are gone, we are perfectly fine with physically mashing the start button on the remote on our way out the door.
<br>
<br>Anyway, this is a good robovac to get if you just want to explore the pleasures of one without breaking the bank, especially if you like to keep things simple. A year or so with this one would certainly be an affordable way to find out what features you might be willing to pay extra for. The first few times we used it, the basin was full and the roller was clogged with hair, as it got all the hidden stuff in the house, but on later runs there was very little to empty and there was no hair to be found, which is proof positive it works great. As a matter of fact, the more we have run it, the less often we have had to do anything, and that is a great feeling. Our house has never felt cleaner. I think I even breathe better at night, wake up less congested and am more refreshed and ready for the day at hand. Maybe it is just a mental thing, but it is definitely a thing none-the-less.",否,5,Arsee,2022-07-17

Currently he keeps getting stuck under my coffee table but I'm planning on putting a little lift under that table so he doesn't get stuck any more. Aside from that, I'm very happy with him. He does go over several areas many times but I'll be honest, it probably needs it. I set him to go do his thing at 1pm every day. What's concerning is that I live alone and he still picks up so much dirt every day. Just a heads up, he's not a smart ma-an. It will take him forever to figure out how to get back to his charging port. That said, he will find it (if you have the patience to watch him ride around and hunt for it - I do not). He charges up and goes again the following day just to get stuck under my trunk again. I'm interested to see what will happen once I lift the trunk up. Will he get stuck somewhere else?

It cleans well and is convenient. I'm pretty impressed with the amount it picks up. I have a lot of tile and was so tired of sweeping! It's just kind of fun to have the little guy running around. That said, I haven't tried programming it to run at night or when we're away because it does seem to get stuck frequently. Not necessarily under things, as it's pretty low clearance, but today I've heard it beep twice and found it just dead in a corner, like it couldn't figure out how to get out and gave up. It confuses me, as I've watched it work it's way out of tighter spots. Most times I run it, there's at least once I have to rescue it and start it back on it's way. The random pattern eventually does get the whole floor. The spot clean works pretty well. I wasnt impressed with the edge clean, but maybe we have too much stuff in the way; I expected it to just run along the walls but it kept going into the middle. The ""home"" button is pretty good, though I usually use the remote to drive it closer to the base rather than watch it wander aimlessly. So, all in all, it's a winner.

<br>
<br>So, after scouring the reviews we decided to try the Eufy. It took a few days to get used to but we like the Eufy better. It is quieter, has more features, has a remote control to direct the cleaner around the room and you can push a button and it will take itself back to the charger.
<br>
<br>One irritant with the Roomba is it really likes to eat USB cables and charger cables, for some reason, the Eufy is not as bad about that. The Eufy still moves things around but doesn't seem to eat cables too often.
<br>
<br>I think the Roomba had a little more volume to store the vacuumed up material than the Eufy, but not by much.
<br>
<br>We like how easy it is to set a schedule via remote for the Eufy, it seems to buzz around for about an hour and 1/2 and then go back to the charger. The debris container is stuffed full of dog hair anyway.

I love the fact that at any point I can just pick it up and carry it to one of our upstairs rooms and let it clean there, and I can be doing things while it’s vacuuming. It will sense when it’s reached an edge and will not go off the stairs. I was amazed that for the first five days it would come back full of dirt even though we vacuumed fairly regularly. Now that it’s running every morning it comes back about half full (we have a dog an a cat), still incredible that it finds that much dirt and hair! It does a pretty good job getting over the transitions in our floor, only occasionally needing a little nudge. It seems to have a sensor directly in front of it and will avoid obstacles straight ahead, the obstacles to the side it will gently bump into and then continue to turn a couple degrees and try again until it gets itself back out.

I use it mostly in the upstairs master bedroom which has dark wood floors which were always dusty--but no more! There's also a short pile area rug slightly around and under the bed which I could never reach the under bed part to vacuum, but this little guy can! And boy does he deliver!! I didn't know we were sleeping over so much dirt and dust. Every single time I run it--and I do it a few times a week now, even when the wood looks clean, it ends up full. I can only assume it's pulling most of that from under the bed (although we do have a couple of shorthaired dogs)! I'm now obsessed with getting to the day when it ends up less full, indicating it's pulled years of dust our from under the bed! For $140 this is a bargain! It was rated #3 in Consumer Reports after 2 other mapping vacuums which were each around $1000. I don't care that it can't map--it seems to get everywhere--maybe just not as quickly.

I just wish the magnetic strips would work with the 11s (I tried, they don't). *One review I saw speculated that the supposed increased suction power of the 30C was because they made the filter system weaker by eliminating a layer. Not sure about that--they seem the same to me.

She ends every cycle with a lot of dust, hair and other debris in the tray, so it's definitely helping things. Just be ready for some care and maintenance to keep it running this long.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Picks up a lot on a daily basis
<br>- Slim design gets under beds, dressers and many chairs
<br>- Reasonably priced compared to other robo vacs
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Not as strong as a regular vacuum. Regularly misses small items that other vacs would pick up.
<br>- Gets stuck occasionally. We have to pick up some small rugs that it always get stuck on, and we block it from certain rooms with lots of wires or clothes on the floor. But it still gets stuck once or twice each cycle, typically on rug fringes and under some kitchen cabinets. When this happens it needs ""rescuing"" so we don't leave it running while we're out.
<br>- We've replaced side brushes every few months. We paid about $13 for 4 brushes. Usually it's because they got tangled and bent on rug fringes.
<br>- At 1.5 years I had to replace both brush motors (one had stopped turning). These cost about $26 for two including shipping. It took some careful effort requiring Youtube videos. After this minor surgery it somehow lost its ability to dock by itself, so now I have to place it on the charger after it's done.
<br>- At 2.5 years I had to replace the battery, as it was not running a full cycle anymore. That cost about $23 and was not difficult to replace.
<br>- At 2.5 years we replaced the rolling brush for about $15 as it was making a lot of noise. Easy.

<br>With all those cons, we still are glad we bought it and like to use it every day. If there was a more reliable one I would be interested, but suspect most will need some maintenance if using it every day for 3 years.",是,5,Richard & Angela Miller,2022-07-01

It has no problems transitioning from linoleum to carpet, though it does occasionally get stuck under a recliner or nightstand. Aaaand once it got stuck humping a floor lamp. As long as I empty the dust bin before turning it on and keep the rollers free from too much hair or any strings it picks up, it happily bumps its way around my apartment leaving my carpets fluffy and soft and clean. Granted, my cats do watch it closely, very concerned for their little drunk friend as it runs into walls and bumps around corners, but they’ve been known to turn it on themselves too (thanks, cats, for helping vacuum up your hair).

I clean it VERY carefully after each use. Nevertheless, it’s started 4 times on its own, without being scheduled! Having a little robot wander around the apartment when it’s not supposed to be wandering is both very dangerous and quite scary, especially if you’re elderly or have young children.
<br>
<br>I’ve spoken to numerous representatives about this, and was told when it happened the third time that we’d get a replacement if it happened again. Well, it did! But we weren’t offered a replacement. What we were offered is a discount on another robot, without any extended warranties. Why, I wonder, would we buy another one from this company?

US,B079QYYGF1,R2R0EEYSEZI54,I think I’m in love???,Color:Black,"Okay. We’ve had this nifty little robot for about a week and my life has CHANGED. First of all, we named her Susan. Why Susan? No idea, but we love her. I had very low expectations. For $150 I thought there was no way it was going to be that good, but the reviews made me bite the bullet and I am so glad I did. We are staying with my in laws this month between our lease ending and closing on our house and all of us were standing around watching her for 20 minutes mesmerized like a bunch of kids. After just a few minutes her tank was pretty full (we have three dogs that shed A LOT). I was nervous our dogs would be scared or try to play with her but they’ve welcomed her into the family with open paws. Not to mention, she goes over rugs like it’s nothing and never bumps into anything. She definitely isn’t silent like some people say, but she’s not at all loud. We even let her go to the top of the stairs and she rolled about an inch off, stopped, and backed up. She hasn’t gotten stuck even once!
<br>
<br>But today, today is what has inspired me to write this review. Around 8 pm we went downstairs to watch a movie. We hadn’t had Susan vacuum all day so I figured I’d let her run in our master bedroom/bath upstairs while we watched the movie and she’d go back to her base in about half an hour when she ran out of battery. Honestly, I completely forgot Susan was up there cleaning. I came back upstairs almost 2 hours later and she was STILL CLEANING! The floors were spotless in the bedroom and the bathroom. I think she must’ve cleaned the whole room 5 times. I think I’d eat dinner off my carpet. You need to get yourself a Susan, you won’t be disappointed. I know what I’m getting my entire family for Christmas!! Even considering getting another one for the second story at our new house, I think Susan needs a friend.",是,5,Madison,2022-06-28

It can not pick up my dog hair well enough when it has to straddle hardwood and carpet. Furthermore, te roller on the bottom, get clogged with pet hair, especially the cat, and then leaves clumps of hair throughout the house. If you dont have a furry pet, and do not deep deep suction on carpet, then this vacuum does well. As a consumer report fan, I was not at all aligned with their perspective. Finally, I have the same Eufy (BoostIQ RoboVac 11S (Slim), Robot Vacuum Cleaner, Super-Thin, 1300Pa) upstairs as downstairs and the one downstairs is already shot that I bought December 8th 2021.

I’ve been struggling to keep my house even moderately clean. If I run Botsky (my name for the vacuum) on about 600 sq feet every other day, I can keep ahead of the mess. The vacuum does about a C job. It misses quite a bit of fur, but it only takes me 5 minutes with a stick vacuum to get the rest—which I appreciate. It is crucial to keep the filters clean. I empty them every time and swap them every other time. Otherwise, the suction is sufficiently diminished that the hair clogs the entry. It does and excellent job with fine dirt and grit.

US,B079QYYGF1,RTHQEUAWA1PFP,WOW! Better than the expensive i-branded one I had!,Color:Black,"I knew this was supposedly a ""step down"" from the more well-known brand of robotic vac I had before but decided to take a chance. I wouldn't have made a change but the dust bin of my old one went missing when I took it out to clean and let it dry. I emailed customer service and that was a joke. ""Don't worry, we'll solve this together."" Next sentence ""Sorry there are no replacement parts available."" Hey, thanks for not helping solve this.
<br>I went to Costco and got that same brand as I had in a more updated version (organized cleaning pattern, not random) but the bottom of the dust bin was broken. So I exchanged it for a different one, the same model. I thought, ""unexpected purchase but, what can I do? I have 3 dogs!"" Well, the 2nd one from Costco would not find our wireless, (which I had heard about that being a problem). It wouldn't connect no matter what - even to a temporary roomba connection. My husband was as frustrated as I, he detests going to Costco. So one more trip to return that defective one and we didn't try again. I can tell you that the i-4 was much cheaper looking that my old roomba, an 891. And what does it say about them that I had 2 in a row that had quality issues?
<br>So I started researching things. My DIL has the eufy and seems happy enough with it, so when I saw a video of this model, I watched it and was pretty impressed. It is much less random in its ""randomness"" that the i-robot that I had. And we have a small house pretty full of furniture and rugs, so I can't picture how a robotic vac that works in rows would even function in our house. So I ordered this eufy. And I am so glad I did!
<br>I like that:
<br>*This model was less expensive than the other brand! I got a protection plan and still spent SO much less than I would have on an that other brand
<br>*There is no app to deal with (You might think an app is a plus but it can be annoying.)
<br>*I know there is a newer model available but I like this one with a remote. (I have to make sure my 2YO grandson doesn't hide it tho)
<br>*You can tell it to edge clean and it gets all those little villages of dog hair. So satisfying to watch!
<br>*The quality of the unit is better than the roomba
<br>*It's SO quiet! I forget about it and it's back at the home base like a good doobie
<br>*It does not eat my rugs like the roomba, that thing was the WORST - so frustrating. It made holes in them and wrecked more than one rug. The eufy goes over them and has a BOOST mode to deal with them. I have all tile floors with rugs at entryways, under the dining table, and under the coffee table.
<br>*As noted above, this model has different modes.
<br>Note: The eufy if not as tall as my last one and both of them get stuck under furniture. So that's a wash. But at least the eufy is not annoying like that other brand when it gets stuck. And one of the brushes fell off a few times when I first got it, but it's good now.

<br>I've only run this machine twice so far. I will say that it's irratic movements made me wonder how the heck is it going to be thorough? Well.....it surprised me when I returned to inspect the rooms it visited. Not only did it do a good job on the wood floors and deep carpet, it got to many places we never could get to with our stand-up machine.

<br>
<br>This vacuum works great for keeping wood and laminate floors clean. It takes up the dried, dirt dog prints, boot prints, dust in the corners, anything on the cowhide rug, good on the tile, BUT it became much less efficient when i had to remove the spinners from the front because they kept getting caught on the edges of the rug. Even without them, it still did great everywhere except the corners.
<br>
<br>It needed to be emptied daily, or even more often if it ran more than once cycle that day. It really did do a good job at helping to keep up with the floor mess.
<br>
<br>I have stopped using it after about 6 months due to one huge issue: It jams every single run with the dog hair. Husky's shed a LOT and thats something thats been hard for any vacuum other than a shop vac, and this is easy enough to clean out, but still a pain.

I was excited to try them out since we are both OCD when it comes to clean floors and both have mostly smooth, hard floors (hers are tile and mine are wood). I followed the instructions and after charging was excited to see what it would do. I tried mine out first and had faith based on reviews that even though it followed a random cleaning pattern it would get the job done. It hits some areas multiple times while it completely misses certain spots. It will be cleaning an area then suddenly change direction midway to miss the rest of the room. It can twirl around in one section as if its caught in a box then eventually manages to leave the section but much time and battery wasted - the brushes can send dirt flying instead of caching it. I tried using the remote to steer it into the areas it misses but after a few commands it stopped responding to the remote. It seems when it heads to the dock it will go the longest way possible around the house even if it’s only 10 feet from the dock. It definitely vacuums well, picking up a lot of dust &amp; trash but what’s the use of it misses more spots than my 20 year old sweeping? Same experiences with my girlfriend’s house.

It has great reviews, it looks nice, and its not going to break the bank. Unfortunately, after the unboxing and getting it set up I decided to let it do its thing and I turned it on. From what I can tell there are no underlying systems that it utilizes to operate. It simply has a bumper on the front and runs itself into things until it find a wall to go against, occasionally darting in the opposite direction after a few seconds. I've read from other comments that compared to many of these types of vacuums it has good suction, unfortunately it spend 99% of the time I use either vacuuming the exact same spots over and over again or it gets stuck on my wife's computer desk leg and just cycles on top of it since it cant reach the leg to bump itself and try a different direction. Its great that it has superior suction ability to most of the other vacuums it would just be nice for it to use it on something other than the exact same two spots it somehow inevitably finds its way into. I've gone back to a manual vacuum and now have a very cool looking useless robot that hangs out on my floor. The one area I agree with many others on and would rate it highly is, its a great distraction for my dog, he loves to just follow it around until it gets stuck then he just barks at it.",是,2,John Cosgrove,2022-06-02

<br>
<br>It gets two stars because there are so many little niceties with it (cleaning brushes, extra brush, instructions written on device, remote holder on charger, etc.). Also, it sure can pick up all that stuff on your floor... if it's small. But it will need assistance every time it tries to do anything.
<br>
<br>But it doesn't matter how much it can suck if it takes 2 hours to figure out the other half of the room exists! I don't even think this thing knows what a straight line is. I was under the impression it would map out the house slightly as it has ""edge clean"" and ""find home"" features. Or, at the very least, avoid bumping into everything and trying to go downstairs (yeah that feature is a hit or miss...).
<br>
<br>How does it find it's base station? the same way it cleans. Completely going in random directions until it sees what I presume is a infrared light emitted by the base station and docks itself.
<br>How does it clean under chairs? By you hand holding it. It'll get stuck, if not avoid attempting in the first place. I was amazed it actually made it past my office chair once.

I'm a guy who hates to vacuum. A friend gave it to me because he bought two on one of Amazon's black Friday deals. He thought he needed two for his three bedroom apartment but said after using the first one it was all he needed. He gave it to me telling me I would love it. I didn't do anything with it at first thinking it was too much of a hassle to setup. Honestly i thought it was a gimmick everyone was falling for not worth really trying for an appartment my size. Another friend who had the same model convinced me it was easy and worth it.
<br>
<br>I'm amazed. The botvac hasn't got stuck on anything yet, so far. It sure likes to vacuum under my couch and bed. It even made it over the floor tracks for the closet sliding door and cleaned the little open space left on the closet floor. It is pretty quiet. It is easy to use with no complicated features. I even think my elderly parents could use it! I was amazed on how much it picked up and held in the tiny dust tray. At first when I started the auto clean it aimlessly with no apparent intelligence wandered back and forth in the enclosed area I put it (no I didn't care about the six foot open aera the instructions tell you to put it in. I set it up againt a wall with two feet on one side of the base and maybe 10 inches on the otherside. So far it doesn't seem to care.) After a few minutes though it found its way around my living room into my bedroom, kitchen area and bathroom making it over any doorway raised areas. I've added a couple of pictures showing what it has climbed over so far without getting stuck.

This little guy has done that and more! It was a breeze to set up, and now every morning our little robot friend Bing Bong (Pixar fans know what's up) bumbles around the house cleaning up hair, dirt and crumbs.
<br>Our main floor is hard wood with several throw rugs, including one rather thick one in the kitchen, and he climbs over them with ease, sucking up everything in his path. He's only gotten stuck once since we've had him, under a kitchen chair. We just moved him out and started him again. It's the one chore that my 4 year old LOVES to do, and honestly it's amazing when we clean the filter out how much he picks up! I do need to cut my long hair off his roller brush about once a week, and he doesn't do exceptionally well in corners, but I just sweep the corners into the main area about once a week and let it ride. We notice if we forget to run him for a day or so, so he's definitely doing a lot as he meanders around the main floor every morning. He even goes into the carpeted landing heading downstairs (but doesn't fall down the stairs!) so I'd imagine even if you have carpets he'd be just fine!
<br>We do have one throw rug with fringe that I either block off access to or roll up so Bing Bong can get around it, for the instructions mentioned he is not kind to fringe and I did not want to learn the hard way. It's in a place that's super easy to block off though, so we have no issues there. The cat has also gone from ""absolute panic"" to ""I don't like it but I know I'm safe upstairs"" when we run him, so hopefully in time he can be like those cats on Insta and ride him around.

We had a German Shepherd who produced a massive amount of hair which this vac sought out and picked up. This model uses a remote so I don't have to mess with any Bluetooth connection which makes it easy peasy! It has become an official member of the family!",是,5,Light Wings,2022-05-16

This thing is incredible. I set it to vacuum when I'm out at work and when I come home everything just *feels* clean.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3Q85XYNNA2NVI,Disappointed,Color:Black,I have been an avid Eufy fan since 2017. Their quality has tanked. Brush covers are now three pieces instead of one. Good luck cleaning that easily. The brush rollers themselves are stripping out in three uses. Once it strips out it burns up the motor if you don't catch it in time. We have had several replacements shipped due to this issue. We are on our 4th replacement in 6 months. This is not the same quality we are used to. Our first Eufy lasted three years. I am afraid they have cut quality for profit. My suggestion is to pay a little more and get an iRobot. It has held up better with less part changes.,是,1,Mom-of-three,2022-05-14

US,B079QYYGF1,R3B1LBD34J284A,Life Changing!,Color:Black,"I saw this little vacuum recommended by Young House Love. They have never steered me wrong. I am very bad at vacuuming regularly. I typically only vacuum maybe every 3-4 weeks. When I first saw them recommend this, I saved it in my cart for ""one day"". We recently found out that my child is allergic to dust, and that made me pull the trigger on this purchase. The amount of dust, hair, etc. that this thing picks up every single day is impressive. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE LIVED IN THIS MUCH DUST, HAIR, ETC.!!
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>-I really like that it is remote controlled and does not need an app or to even be connected to the internet. That was really my first reason in choosing this one.
<br>- Once you hit the auto button, Eufy just goes around your house. It never goes in the same pattern. It ""bounces"" around your house. It goes under my couches, chairs, dressers, beds. Our traditional vacuum cannot reach under our beds or dressers or nightstands. I would have to move my couches and chair to vacuum under there myself. I literally had not vacuumed under our bed since we moved in a year ago. Now it gets vacuumed regularly!
<br>- It vacuums for about 2 hours straight just going back and forth all over your house. LIFE CHANGING!
<br>- It is easy to clean. I love that everything comes apart/separates to get all the hair and random threads loose from the brushes. I empty the compartment and use our hand vac to clean the filter after every cleaning. I feel like Danny Tanner vacuuming my vacuum!
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- It doesn't seem to sense dark furniture, so it often runs straight into it. It can see our white baseboards and slows down and eases up to them.
<br>- It always seems to gravitate towards going under one of our couches. It often gets stuck under that couch which is frustrating; it's like it can go under the couch but can't find it's way out.
<br>- Sometimes it misses a whole bedroom room, so the next day if I see that it still hasn't found it's way into the room when it is on that side of the house, I just pick it up and put it in there.
<br>- I have found whenever it is finished and time to recharge (when the light turns orange), Eufy becomes very stupid. It will go in the total opposite direction of the charger. It will pass the charger by completely and go get stuck under our couch, etc. I think it has docked itself maybe 2 times out of 3 weeks of operation. I know to check on it at the end of the two hours, so I end up just picking it up and placing it in front of the docking station. Then, it just moves forward into the charger.
<br>
<br>Unless you are in a stage of life where you have no little objects (toys, pokemon cards, etc.) around your house, you do have to baby sit the vacuum a little bit to make sure it doesn't get stuck on anything that you didn't know ended up under your furniture. I work from home, so it has not been an issue for me...but I would not trust it to run without no one here.
<br>
<br>Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum. Our house is unbelievably cleaner. You really can't beat having your house vacuumed every single day and all you do is push a button. I feel like I am helping my family to be healthier also by removing the dust, etc. every day....now if they just made a vacuum to dust furniture and clean the bathrooms, we'd be good to go.

<br>It accomplishes the task and misses some spots.
<br>
<br>It lives up to its product description. I received exactly what I intentionally ordered: an unsmart, autonomous vaccuum, that wasn't programmable, and doesn't memorize the floor plan, and not blue tooth enabled.
<br>And, that is what I received.
<br>
<br>Where I give it 3 stars vs 5:
<br>1. It does miss cleaning some spots (especially near its docking base).
<br>2. It doesn't tell me when it's full.
<br>3. Hair gets wound around the wheels and brush, but doesn't tell me something stopped working or moving.
<br>
<br>Notes (performs as described, but you need to prepare for the cleaning): It doesn't seem to ""see"" things and avoid them
<br>1. When I forget to pick up my computer cord, and it drags the laptop off the desk
<br>2. Or bumps into the tray table and spills my coffee
<br>3. Make sure you empty it after each use, because it will still ""go through the motions"", but when full, you will see it can't store your dirt and leaves it on the floor.
<br>
<br>Previously I had a Shark robot, that was programmable, I didn't think it was necessary to replace it with a programmable robot, that was hundreds more expensive.
<br>Because the Shark, didn't see the dog poop, thus tracked right through it and did circles on my floor, grinding it into the carpet, and smearing it all into its wheels, and suction components- it was so covered in poopage that it was worth it to me, to toss the NEW Shark, and buy Eufy.",是,3,Beth Wilson,2022-05-11

<br>On to the 11S Max.... When it was time to replace the 11S, I figured it would be better to upgrade and go with the Max. It has a distinctive flaw that allows it to constantly push itself into areas that it cannot get out of. Is rare to get through a single cleaning without the Max getting stuck. So it is constantly stopping what you're doing and restarting the vac. Eufy also took a step backwards with the Max when it comes to the ecology. The 11S had a disposable paper filter that we changed every couple of weeks. The Max also has a disposable filter but it is encased in a plastic frame. One piece, easy change but you must dispose of the entire piece with each replacement. Not at all eco friendly. In the end I'd buy the 11S over the 11S Max anytime.",是,2,Kathy Fowler,2022-05-09

I still wanted to give it a shot and with just 3ft on either side and 2ft in front it’s able to still dock itself! Not gunna lie it struggles lmao but it works!
<br>
<br>As for how the vacuum works, it’s amazing! I do only use it manually, I haven’t tried setting it up to run automatically but that’s only because I have rugs it struggles to run over. I was really hoping it would be able to vacuum those as well but the spinning arms kept getting caught on the edge of them and either getting stuck or folding the rug over. I am going to attempt to use rug tape to stick them into place and see if that helps, if it does I will definitely update my review. For now I just pick them up, shake them off and then just push start and let it run for a while. It cleans everything up no problem and saves me time from having to breakout our vacuum and do it myself! It seems to work just as well and the ones that cost double or even more. Needless to say, I highly recommend this vacuum. RV or house, if you have cat litter issues like me it will save your life!",是,5,Carolynne,2022-05-07

Now, 6 months after purchasing, I can say that the Eufy is still going strong. Picks up pet hair pretty well (and very well from hardwood floors) and in general does a great job.
<br>
<br>The one thing that I need to add is that, if you are finding the performance going down, be sure to change the filters every month. You don't need to buy new filters; just wash the ones that are in there. (Take them out, wash them, let them dry, and then put them back in. ) You will be amazed at how much silt you find.

<br>After the first use, covering 3 rooms that are all carpeted I was amazed how much it picked up. I ran it three times and there was still picking up more stuff. I’m sure it’s all coming from hard to reach areas that this vac can get to easily. It’s really impressive.
<br>
<br>I have found that you need to stay up on cleaning the vac regularly to keep it running well. It takes 5 minutes to clean either the included tools. This is my first experience with a robot vac and I don’t have anything to compare it too but I will purchase another Eufy for the other level of my house.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2RDYZCQMHZGMZ,IT'S JUST OK - Here are the answers to the most important questions:,Color:Black,"I had several questions when I got this yesterday, so here are the answers:
<br>Does this connect to an app or cell phone?: No.
<br>Does it have the ability using the remote control to confine itself to one room or just the entryway where all the dirt tracks in?: No.
<br>Does it have the ability to schedule itself to clean at night?: Yes.
<br>Doe it have the ability to schedule itself to travel to the specific area that I want cleaned at night and clean that?: - No.
<br>Does it get stuck and stop and require attention a lot?: Yes.
<br>Enough to be pointless?: No.
<br>Since there's no app... When it STOPS is there a readout on the remote control that tells me what went wrong?: No.
<br>Is there a readout on the vacuum that tells me what went wrong?: No.
<br>How do I find out what went wrong?: BEEPS. When it stops it beeps repeatedly like morse code. It beeps 4 times in rapid succession to say ""my main brush is stuck""... then it pauses for 1 second, and beeps four times in rapid succession again. - There are different beep pulses for different problems. You have to learn to speak robot.
<br>What are the worst dangers?: Cables and wires. They stop it reliably.
<br>If it encounters an odd obstacle, it just gives up and leaves that area uncleaned, right?: No. It commits the entirety of its ridiculous little existence to DYING ON THAT HILL and keeps fighting the entryway to your cat's liter box or the base of your microphone stand in pointless little 2 inch circles until it goes into kernel panic and sounds an alarm.
<br>IF I BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE WILL THE FLOOR MAPPING IN THE APP ENABLE IT TO ACTUALLY GO CLEAN THE SPECIFIC AREA THAT I WANT CLEANED EACH NIGHT AT 3AM?: I have no idea. That's my biggest question.",是,3,Captain Spanky Of Nazareth,2022-04-26

US,B079QYYGF1,R3KIVTSV68VJZ1,Great entry-level robot vacuum,Color:Black,"Highly recommend as a ""gateway"" robot vacuum! I had been considering a robot vac for years, but never wanted to shell out for the fancier versions in case I ended up disliking it. This Eufy is a great buy for what I need. It does a solid job picking up dust, hair, and kitchen debris. I have hardwood floors and lots of rugs of varying thickness and it has been able to navigate them all. I like the simplicity - though I can see how a vacuum with an app and more tech features could be great, I just wanted something I could click on whenever. All I need to do is ensure there aren't any tangle hazards in the way (shoelaces, rug fringe) and it's good to go. I like the remote and the features, such as the ability to just have it clean up a targeted mess (goes in circles) and the ability to set it in a room and just let it go until it's done. It's easy to pick up and move to other floors/rooms. It has good sensors and bumpers (for avoiding stairs and other obstacles). It's not too loud either - WAY quieter than a traditional vacuum.",是,5,Yumdonuts,2022-04-25

Customer Support was most unhelpful informing me that batteries have to be replaced regularly -- something that is not mentioned anywhere in the product information even on the Eufy site.

<br>FiFi is a very thin lady. She fits under my standard size sectional couch. Which I LOVE!!!
<br>She will get tangled up in clothes, blankets and cords. But that just means you FiFi proof the house before she runs.

US,B079QYYGF1,RT0UPHG8M362A,Don’t be afraid if you have long haired pets!!!,Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.      &nbsp;I genuinely never write reviews but I had done myself a disservice for YEARS by thinking that, because I have long haired dogs, I could never reap the benefits of something like this. This has been a total game changer! I have a Great Pyrenees and a Husky/Shepherd mix and live in a two story house. This thing is not phased. After the first few rounds of cleaning up my mess, I find that I really only have to empty the canister once or twice on each floor, again there’s a lot of hair in this house. And I really only need to charge it once per floor depending on how much dirt we’ve tracked in. It has started to learn the house and even avoids the high pile shag carpet in the living room that it used to get stuck on, it now follows the perimeter instead. I think it even gets the dog hair off of chair legs better than I would vacuuming manually because of the detail. The more you run it the more it seems to “learn”. It comes with a tool for cleaning the brush head that even makes my long hair easy to remove COMPLETELY - I included a video because I find it that notable. The brush head pops out too so you’re not awkwardly trying to rotate it while pulling off hair like a medieval era wool spinner. I have the Dyson Animal due to a severe dust mite allergy and large dog addiction and I never thought a robot vacuum could come close.
<br>Biggest thing to set yourself up for success is making sure to pick up any toys with strings, organize your cords and just pay attention to things a “regular vacuum would have issues with, the other day mine started beeping and there was a sock halfway in it - I missed it under the bed before running it. Also just large items like dog toy stuffing, it’s going to clog it so just make sure you do the easy work of picking that stuff up first so you spend less time solving those issues when it’s running.
<br>If I could afford it, this would be my house warming, wedding, new baby present for any of my friends, it’s SO helpful. The satisfaction of hearing it cleaning in the next room while you're unloading the dishwasher is a feeling you’re definitely missing out on.",是,5,Sabrina Murillo,2022-04-23

I have had to replace the brush when I have been too lazy to clean it. When it gets too full it gets stuck and the square plastic end gets rounded by the vacuum and then won't spin. Cheap and easy to replace. The filters and spinning wires that feed the brush are also inexpensive and easy to replace. The most major replacement was the battery. It died after about a year and was a whopping $30 to replace. 😉 Overall, it does everything the expensive brands do and is powerful enough to handle our pet hair situation.

US,B07R295MLS,R3R7Q6JYIGX2VE,It works great but its VERY fragile.,Color:Black,"I got this robovac having owned older model iRobot versions.
<br>This one worked just as well if not better and was very quiet.
<br>BUT... I also have things. Kids toys, wire under the tv or computer, fringe on a throw rug...
<br>These are all FATAL to Eufy side brushes. Though the device has sensors to determine when the brushes are stuck they are not sensitive enough and the gears in the brushes break first time they encounter any trouble.
<br>After that, its loud and the brushes slip until you replace the side brush motor and gears (they don't sell the gears separately). It may also be a bit more than most people would want to get into taking apart and putting back together. Its not fun. Very compact. Tight toleranceees.
<br>I have replaced the gears several times over the last several months of ownership. Finally I just started printing my own. Its such a big problem the 3d printing world engineers have come up with ""upgraded"" versions of the gears. They're more sturdy and don't strip (when printed correctly) but they are also very noisy. Reminds me of my 2005 iRobot waking me up when I worked nights. No watching tv with the robot going... not a problem if you work I suppose.
<br>
<br>Anyway... unless your house has NO thick rugs and no strings or wires of any kind that will ever get in it's way, I'd avoid this product.

The cartridge fills up daily and the screen gets coated in pet fur, but as long as we vacuum it out daily then it works amazingly well.

However, it got hung up on area rugs (yes the directions say anything that is under 0.60 inches (that’s rather tall!). It also kept losing the side sweepers, and at the end of it all, never found it’s way back to base. It just rolled around the house like a lost puppy. Heartbreaking.

US,B079QYYGF1,REATAYY8XZL2Q,I love my new hypoallergenic robot pet!,Color:Black,"The media could not be loaded.      &nbsp;I’m really picky and skeptical about what I buy. Months ago, I compared at least 15 different robot vacuum models, including all of the Eufy versions. Then I decided not to buy one at all; I figured the robovac industry is still in its infancy and that I’d better wait until a more perfect yet affordable model came out. I’d decided to just use my manual vacuum more often and save money or wait for a really good deal.
<br>
<br>Oh boy, I was wrong. I needed Eufy more than I knew.
<br>
<br>The spring season came forth and my cat and dog started shedding like crazy. Every time I went out and came back in, I’d track in pollen on my shoes and clothes. My dog would shake and pollen would go everywhere. My allergies started raging too.
<br>
<br>Vacuuming every day wasn’t enough. The dog hair would clog my standard vacuum and I’d end up cleaning the vacuum out more than cleaning the floor.
<br>
<br>So then I went back to check out this Eufy model. Since I’m expecting tax returns, I figured it was worth it. It arrived in one day and my life changed. This vacuum sucks up dog and cat hair better than my regular vac. Even more impressive, it sucks up tiny dust and pollen particles instead of spreading them all around in the air. I love the replaceable filter. Cleaning out Eufy is easy. I wear rubber gloves to empty its “tummy” contents over the garbage. The pollen and stuff falls straight into the garbage; it doesn’t go flying in my face like when I the normal vacuum.
<br>
<br>I started to see Eufy as a friend. I gave him glow-in-the-dark googly eyes to welcome him into the family. The dog and cat don’t understand their new robot sibling or how much Eufy cleans up after them.
<br>
<br>I hope Eufy has a long lifespan. I’ll keep this review updated. Cheers!",是,5,Rickie,2022-04-14

So I purchased a new unit for $199 from Amazon, for which there was a $40 off coupon, and because the order was over $25 I received free shipping. SOMEHOW Eufy contrived to subtract the $40 and $10.85 shipping refund from the purchase price, and then decided my refund amount would be $30. That was very bad faith on the part of Eufy, and any future buyers should be aware of their business practices. While the vacuum worked it it did a reasonable job, but they build it with parts that are bound to fail within a short time.

<br>
<br>1. Gets stuck constantly under chairs and sofas. Cannot find its way out. Just spins and not go anywhere. I left it one time and it remained stuck until the battery died.
<br>
<br>2. Will get stuck on a threshold and try’s to climb it. Not real smart.
<br>
<br>3. Will not return home even after pushing the remote to send home. Will just die where it lays.
<br>
<br>4. Never know what part of the house or room it will clean. Have one room it hasn’t cleaned yet. I actually put it in the room and shut the door.
<br>
<br>5. Gets stuck all the time in deep pile area rugs. It loves to go to the area rugs just to piss me off. Then it just spins even on turbo boost.
<br>
<br>6. Do no understand the high ratings for this unit. They must have no furniture or area rugs.

It picked up about two thirds of the dirt on the floor. It's annoying to have to put things down to block the unit from places in which it will get stuck, but so be it. It's impossible to figure out its pattern of movement, because it doesn't have one. It appears to move randomly around the house, going over the same area several times and missing others entirely. Some reviewer aptly described these things as dumb as a bag of hammers. I would have given it four stars back then. In the last few weeks, though, it has started itself up at night. I thought I might have a start time programmed into the unit, so I checked this and found that there was no programmed start time. I took the batteries out of the remote just in case the problem was there. It wasn't. For a couple weeks, the thing started at 2:06 a.m., and I had to get up to shut it down. More recently, it has changed to 1:09 a.m. If I don't remember to turn it off at the switch on the underside, I will be getting out of bed.

I'm not looking forward to having to replace the battery already.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- You can trap it in a room for an hour and it'll clean it spotless.
<br>- It sucks up pet hair like a dream! This thing is ALWAYS full after a run around and it makes me wonder where all this dust and hair are hiding....
<br>- It's very satisfying to watch. Sometimes I just watch it move around and pick up dirt, because its path is so satisfying.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- I can't trust it in certain rooms (e.g. office, closets, etc) anywhere there are potential strings or cords. It will suck them up then cry for help.
<br>- The suction power COULD be stronger, but then again it would pick up a lot more things that it shouldn't.
<br>- It tends to push dirt under rugs and pulls up rug corners sometimes. Not a huge con though.

<br>These are minor annoyances compared to the convenience of not having to manually vacuum, but I'm assuming most people that buy these want them so they don't have to mess with them.

You have to really untangle hair after every use. My old Roomba had rollers with a textured rubber design that handled pet hair much better. It still jammed after a while but didn't require as frequent of cleaning. It served me pretty well for a few years before dying. I went for the Eufy, truthfully, because it was cheaper. It's very quiet and low profile for getting under things. The vacuum algorithms are not very good so it misses a lot of floor. You can see the long strips of dust left on the hardwood. The Roomba, in comparison, moves back and forth like a manual vacuum cleaner being pushed by a person. Also, the Eufy's battery life isn't great and it stopped charging all together after six months.

US,B07R295MLS,R2LTBCLC4I7KAH,Surprised at what she comes up with,Color:Black,"This is my second robotic vacuum. We specifically chose the 11 S model because of its low profile and the fact that it is not as noisy as some of the other vacuums out there. We named ours “Alice “after they maid from the Jetsons. Alice does a great job most of the time. However, she does get stuck on pretty much anything you leave laying around so you really need to pay attention to what’s on the floor or she will get stuck on shoelaces, extension cords, charging cables, anything that she can get up onto and get the wheels off contact with the floor. However on the positive side I will say that the amount of stuff that this thing picks up is exceptional. I empty it nearly every day and I’m amazed at how much stuff is in the waste bin. The little spinning whiskers on the front can easily be removed and cleaned and straightened out again by running them under hot water and then let them air dry. I have a compressor in my garage for my tools and I easily blow out the air filter from time to time which makes it as good as brand new. The remote control is helpful if you want to “drive it “otherwise it’s useful for setting the schedule and that’s about it. I have mine on a daily schedule, she comes on at 10 AM does her thing and always seems to find her way back to the charging station. That is a huge plus. Things that I don’t like about her is not necessarily under her control. Human hair seems to be the biggest obstacle for hours. I have two women that live at home that “shed “ all the time and if I ever find Alice just sitting in the middle of the floor not doing anything when I come home, it’s typically because enough human hair has wrapped around the rotating bristles and I guess they have a safety feature built-in where if there’s too much resistance on that bristle it automatically shuts off. So I know to flip her over , take the round brush head off which is simple, clean off the hair which they give you a tool for, reinstall it and she’s good to go I guess I can’t really complain for her doing her job. Overall I recommended this model to several family and friends and would still recommend it.",是,4,Tommy D,2022-03-26
US,B079QYYGF1,RYAL0JSUL61UY,Worth buying,Color:Black,"I've had this Eufy for quite a while, but wouldn't recommend this particular model. Get one that comes with boundary strips. We have had constant problems with it getting stuck under our couch. It goes under where there's only floor, then gets stuck because part of the couch is on a rug, and it doesn't have enough clearance to come out. Also, though it started out fairly quiet, it's really loud now, and we can't figure out the problem. We still use it because we don't want to pay the price for a new one, but....... Loud, really loud! So, though it still vacs pretty good, I would recommend looking into a different model.",否,3,Norma Baker,2022-03-26

It had weak suction, tiny dirt holder and only ran for maybe 30 minutes even on a full charge. I'll never buy an over-priced Roomba again. So as we are getting older the lazy wife and I decided to try a robot vac again, this Eufy by Anker BoostIQ RoboVac 11S (Slim) had very good reviews, and it was on sale, so we bought it. Construction is excellent (better than Roomba) and operation with the remote, which is confusing still, is a big PLUS! It works very-very good on tile and wood floors, sucking up all the crumbs, dirt and dust bunnies. On low pile carpets, it's Great! But beware, it still is a bit stupid (like an Amazon Echo) and gets caught under low couches and things and will get tangled up in even heavy ""throw carpets""! I wish it had a Beeper Alarm when it gets stuck or fouled up (hear that Anker???). Bottom line: It's definitely worth the money, half the price of an over-priced Roomba.

I’ve only been using it on a laminated wood floor with light grime/debris.
<br>You can set a schedule for it to automatically run daily. It will run for (cruising around randomly, no mapping here) for about 1 hour 40 mins (regular power) and then return itself to the docking station.

<br>Haven’t tested it in carpet. I expect hair will probably get tangled a bit like with most other vacuums. So I plan to be proactive to keep it from becoming a problem.

It will suck up the cat litter out of my mats. The two whirling brushes on the front do a much better job than the one on the Roomba. It’s slightly more difficult to clean, but the suction makes it worth it. The fact that it’s lower to the ground than Roomba means it gets stuck on transitions more easily, but can clean (and hide and get stuck sometimes) under more furniture. For $400+ less than Roomba, I say eufy is the winner hands down.

I only have about 700 square feet that I want cleaned - a one-bedroom apartment. It has a mind of its own, and mostly refuses to spend any time cleaning in my main living space, which is where I need it to clean. It prefers to spin around and around in my bedroom, either under the bed (which I have now blocked off with underbed boxes) or under a chair in the corner. I will pick it up and place it in the main room, and it will bump its way back to the bedroom. It is good about picking up dust, etc. from the floor, but hair just gets caught up on the wheels, which has to be cleaned out using scissors.

I call her Mrs. Doubtfire and may purchase a twin to work upstairs as well. Timer was easy to set after reading the directions. Cleaning her out is a regular occurrence. She rarely gets stuck but usually only if the floor is cluttered woth cords or something. She also stops when she's full and needs to be cleaned instead of burning out her own motor which I think is nice.

The randomizing function seems to cover most of my house within one or two days. Plus, since it is also suctioning, it doesn't have to touch everywhere. It is thin so it gets under my furniture which is where the dust migrates. I have two dogs and it keeps my house better than it ever was.

It's a good, basic robo-vac which does a great job of vacuuming up our cat's shed fur, large dust bunnies, and some pretty significant-sized crumbs.

We have discovered it is powerful enough to shove task chairs around &amp; knock over small wastebaskets.
<br>
<br>It is just smart enough to find its way out of most tight spots. It does have to be within 6 ft. of its docking station when you hit the 'home' button. The remote is handy because it simply parks itself when the timed room-cleaning cycle is done, and that is sometimes beneath a large piece of furniture such as the bed. With the remote, that's no problem because you can simply start it up again &amp; steer it out to where it can be reached. Biggest problem we've had is that the beater bar tends to collect long fibers such has hairs or threads which then need to be removed.

As someone with long hair, wall to wall carpet, a couple of dogs and hates to vacuum, this vac is small but mighty. It cruises around and does all the work for me. If only it could do stairs, I'd be in heaven.
<br>
<br>But seriously, it does a great job. Just be mindful of electrical cords, shoe laces and other miscellaneous things it could get tangled in before you set free. Also, if you're pet owner, be sure your furry friend hasn't left any surprises around, which could make for a real mess!!! Occasionally, it gets itself trapped in spots but it beeps and turns itself off until you can rescue it. It fits under the coffee table and under my bed with ease. It's round so it doesn't get into corners too well but it transitions easily from carpet to tile and over thresholds. And it's easy to take the roller bar apart and remove hair and debris.
<br>
<br>My dogs hate the regular vacuum almost as much as I do, but don't mind this one nearly as much. They still avoid it and stay on the couch when it's loose. I've wanted a robot vac for years but the cost prevented me from getting one. I'm so glad I found this one at a reasonable price.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3AMFWSQZR2AHQ,Overall a good little robot vacuum,Color:Black,"This was our first experience with a robot vac and I admit I was skeptical. Bought as a gift for a senior citizen with a very large kitchen who has radar for the littlest amount of dirt so I assumed it wouldn’t be too effective. Right out of the box there was some minor set up but for the most part it was ready to charge. Once charged, “Curly” as we started calling it bounced around the first couple of times, learning the floor plan. Now we are 1-1/2 months in and Curly knows most of the tricks of the house! I was astounded when Curly made a complete circle around each leg of the kitchen chairs, and transitions from hardwood to low carpet seamlessly. My only complaint is that the “home” button on the remote does not send Curly scampering back to base as it should. Instead, Curly seems to turn it’s robotic head away from the base and carry on with its mission until it runs out of steam in some random place in the house. While not the end of the world for most, the senior involved is not able to pick it up and bring it back to the base so it isn’t really doing what I needed it to do. Minus one star for going rogue.

<br>Beautiful chaos. My floors are clean! Always! I can take my socks off and walk around, without cringing at the feel of tiny little black hairs collecting on my feet. My bedsheets are clean. My lint collector isn’t completely black. My dog is happier now that I don’t glare at her while I vacuum.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3BQKI35V1ENA7,Not for pet homes,Color:Black,"I bought this little vacuum to replace my older vacuum. To be honest, the only pro I have found with this vacuum is that it’s quiet. It gets stuck on nearly everything and I don’t even have that much on my floor. It gets stuck the base of my pedestal fan every single day. When it gets stuck it doesn’t turn itself off, it continues to run until the battery dies. I have all wood flooring, so I thought it would perform well to pick up dust and cat hair. Wrong. The spin brush doesn’t actually deposit anything into the canister unless it’s heavier than dust or pet hair. So any hair gets tangled up in the spin brush and nothing actually goes into the container. Also I can’t get it to run the entirety of my home. It’s not that it runs out of battery, it just won’t go to certain areas unless I physically take it there. Not impressed at all.",是,3,CBeckRun,2022-03-18
US,B079QYYGF1,RF8BAED16XYOP,The best part about it - I don’t have to vacuum,Color:Black,"I’ve had this for a week now - and truth be told I’ve let him (we call it a him for some reason) vacuum about 5 times already!!
<br>
<br>Look we’re two years into Covid and I’m still working from home, and walking around from time to time to clear my head sometimes stresses me out when you look around and are like, “I should vacuum cause it’s getting dusty, or —- yeah dog hair is everywhere and I just vacuumed two days ago.” So I thought - everyone has jumped on this robot vacuum bandwagon and maybe I should to. Well for 159 am I glad I did!!! If this little guy can fit under your table, chairs, couches and other things, it’s going to get under them and clean the heck out of your floors. A few things to be mindful about - 1) tidey up your wires cause it will get stuck in those wicked little spinner brushes, 2) AC/heat vents on the floor can sometimes get him stuck, not always but sometimes, 3) you need to empty the dust bin after each and every time - and you’ll be surprised how much stuff this thing picks up, I know I was!
<br>
<br>Is it perfect maybe not, but it’s perfect for us for 159 bucks… and the best part about it, is that I don’t have to vacuum the dang floor! Sure there are way more pricey ones like this out there that you can program and map out furniture and rooms, but I think dropping Upwards of $500 is kind of a lot for something like this, so if you’re on the fence like I was about getting something like this, the price is right and the job is well done!",是,5,R.

She gets beneath most of the furniture, although she will get stuck if I don’t catch her before she heads beneath the couch.
<br>
<br>Not sure why there are so many negative reviews here. She does require maintenance, like any other vacuum. You do have to pop out the roller brush and keep the other brushes free of hair and debris. It’s very easy to do this and it’s very user friendly. A kit is included to help keep it clean and it even has extra spin brushes and a filter. Replacement parts are also easy to find and available to purchase.

We have 2 dogs and 2 cats so being able to effectively pick up pet hair is a must. I realized I don't really need an app neither on my Vaccum. The Eufy was affordable and had all those functions. We had it scheduled everyday and whenever we get home it is docked and the floors are cleaned. I know because I have to empty the tray everyday.

If and when that day comes, I wouldn’t hesitate buy another Eufy because my house has never remained so consistently cleaned.

I returned it right away and bought this one. Well everything was neat and clean and properly wrapped when I took it from the box. It actually looked nice too with the shiny black top side of product. Instructions were super simple and easy to follow. In a matter of minutes this vac was working! It even went from my hardwood floor to my medium pile carpet without so much as a pause. It scooped up super small pieces of pebbles on my floor and quietly scurried onto the next. The remote allows you to direct it where you want it to go or if you want it will make its own way without the need for you to control.

It does have a remote, which I prefer to Wi-Fi connectivity, and it’s quite responsive to the remote.

<br>The problem is that all of my couches and chairs are the perfect height for it to wedge itself under. So I have to always have magnetic tape running underneath everything. It still gets wedged about 5-7 times per run and I have to lift the couch up to get it out. Without magnetic tape, it's almost totally unusable. I usually also have to rescue it from wires a few times per run. A cell phone charger or lamp wire. Anything like that on the floor will cause errors.

I told her about having Eufy and decided to buy her a new battery and give her a go, guess what? She works again! We gave it away to our friend but since we had to try it out with the new battery I noticed that Eufy sucks a lot more than the shark does! Together though, holy cow the results are amazing! I liked the results so much that I bought another one! I work from home and instead of sweeping three times a day this thing is working in the background for me. It’s loud but you can set the time you want it to run so I just don’t schedule meetings while it’s running.

US,B079QYYGF1,RYB7KRZA5J246,Very quiet...surprisingly strong suction,Color:Black,"In short: She gets 4 stars because I haven't had her long enough to give her 5. Work-from-home approved. Picks up more dust than I thought was possible for my home to have.
<br>
<br>I bought this vacuum after googling ""quietest robot vacs"" - the Eufy 11S was one that kept appearing. I was replacing an ~8 year old Neato XV-21 that wasn't recognizing the dustbin anymore, which was *loud* - it was difficult to watch TV in the other room with the door closed. when it was vaccuuming without turning the volume way up.
<br>
<br>I am pleased to report that I have used this Eufy 3 days in a row; before I talk more about the use, I should mention we are a 2 adult, 1 child (5) and 1 cat family. Not too much fur. A whole lot of crumbs. And a whole lot of tennis clay-court dirt.
<br>
<br>The first day it picked up a lot of dust. Like a lot. I had to wait to empty the dustbin just to show my husband. I also used it on the highest suction power setting. It is pretty loud on that one; however my son was able to watch TV no problem with the door closed while I followed Eufy around.
<br>
<br>Day 2. I used it on the normal ""boost IQ"" setting. Much less noise. I thought it wouldn't pick up dirt and dust, but it definitely did.
<br>
<br>Day 3. It got stuck on my bathroom mat which has some tassels and the spinning brushed did NOT like that. They got all twisted so I replaced one with the replacements that come in the box. I have noticed she tends to lift up and then get a little stuck on thin area rugs. Not a deal breaker as this type of rug is only in my home office.
<br>
<br>Some things to note:
<br>- you can definitely use Eufy while you're working from home, the noise is super tolerable. Sounds like an air conditioner window unit.
<br>- She is not the smartest. Very bump and go. BUT, my house is filled with obstacles and she navigates them; I haven't had to go on a rescue mission because she gets stuck in corners yet (just the bathroom mat).
<br>- the box comes with your first set of replacement parts (thank you!) and they are easy to find on Amazon. If you decide to go with another brand of robovac, look and see how easy it is to get replacement parts (filters, brushes, batteries, etc.). I learned the hard way with a coffee maker that had a glass carafe and when it broke it was IMPOSSIBLE to find a replacement. it's been a year and I still haven't found one.
<br>- this is a robovac, obviously there is no comparison to taking out the hoover and vacuuming the floorboards, but for daily use to make sure I am not stepping on crumbs or trailing clay dust throughout the house, it's a win.",是,4,S. A. Stevens,2022-03-07

US,B079QYYGF1,R32LA7LPLCEYPH,"Good job, eufy!",Color:Black,"Wowzers, I absolutely love this little machine. After reading reviews for a few different robovacs I settled on a eufy and I couldn’t be happier. I have 800 sq fr of hardwood floors and a Husky who sheds constantly and I could never stay ahead of the dog hair. I always start the machine manually twice a day, once in the morning, and once at bedtime. The floors have never looked and felt so amazing. The part that holds the debris seemed small but it has been more than big enough for us. I haven’t used all of the features but I can say that you have to manually empty the machine and I take it apart once a week to clean the dog hair out of the roller. It has gotten stuck on shoelaces, hanging leashes, and cords that I didn’t pick up before starting the machine and it was super easy to unstick them and get it started again. The best part for me is that it cleans dust, hair, and dirt from underneath bookshelves, tv stands, and hutches that I haven’t been able to reach with my dust mop. The cycle runs for a couple of hours then returns itself to the base to charge for another hour or so. Lastly, and this is TMI I know, but it ran over poop once and I thought I was going to have to throw the whole machine away. HOWEVER, after taking a week to gather my thoughts, I was able to clean the machine VERY EASILY by removing a few parts and soaking them in bleach water and installing the replacement filters that came with this eufy. It’s not super quiet and it makes some noises as it goes from one surface to another but that doesn’t bother me.
<br>
<br>This was a great purchase. I’ve had it for a couple of months and I’ve used it at least twice a day since purchase and the suction is just as strong today as it was during the first use. Highly recommended for hardwood.",是,5,Mytuangels,2022-02-27

US,B079QYYGF1,R15NRD3GO7ME2T,Gamechanger for cleaning dog hair,Color:Black,"I just moved into a apartment who previously had a tenant who owned a dog. When moving in, even after a professional cleaner went through, the hair was so bad that just touching the carpet would get me covered in hair. I doubt the previous tenant ever vacuumed. I didn't have a vacuum at the time, but the level of hair pushed me to get one of these. My parents had one for some time and they never had issues with it.
<br>
<br>Even after a month of solid daily cleanings, it's still pulling up more dog hair from the carpet. The carpet honestly feels healthier and softer than when I moved in. It's a powerful little thing, so I recommend you be very deliberate in making sure you remove or tuck away loose cords. I've had multiple occasions where it's gotten a hold of my phone charger and yanked it all over my room. The remote control also works well for setting up scheduled cleanings or spot cleaning. I would suggest buying extra parts when you buy it, just so that if something does go wrong, you can quickly replace a piece.",是,5,William,2022-02-26

<br>What I found funny about this sweeper, though, is it doesn’t like the sunshine. I keep my livingroom drapes open so my plants can get the sunshine every day and I don’t have to go open the curtains all the time, so the light shines down on the floor. I don’t have carpet, just tile everywhere, so the light is rather strong. When it got to that, it stopped and turned away. But there was one time when it started inching its way sideways into that light, one little tiny scoot at a time, and when it got all the way in, it stopped and started hollering for help. I had to laugh. It was just like a little baby animal trying out some new territory for the first time, then discovering it was too scary. When my shadow fell over it, it started up again and went about its business. I’ve named it Poki, as in Pokimon, or should I have said Pokemon? . I love this thing.

Also, it steered 3 feet away from my bookshelf yet consistently got stuck under the coffee table - if it has such good detection, how does it not detect the limitation in height?!

BUT after only a year and a half of use (6 months after the warranty expired) one of the two brush motors quit working. I got a replacement brush motor BUT what I found was that the gears inside the motor are PLASTIC and had worn down so they didn't mesh any more. I pointed this OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW out to the company and asked for a replacement but they refused. As expected, the OTHER brush motor failed about 3 months later. They probably knew about this problem because the company has now changed that design in the higher end models but the others all still have plastic gears. Probably saves them a few pennies. BOTTOM LINE: EUFY 11S WILL LAST LESS THAN 2 YEARS. I'm going back to my previous Roomba.

I'm writing from a viewpoint of not having owned a different brand, so I'm sure there are other ones just as good or better.
<br>
<br>When I looked for a robo-vac, we wanted something simple, discreet, and minimalistic without having to spend big bucks. This fit the bill perfectly.

<br>Our first one died after two years. Our second might have lasted longer than 2 years, but I threw it away because it happened to pick a fight with our dogs big poop. Poop won and I didn't want to spend countless hours trying to clean the robo-vac, which is why I bought yet another one. Even if I have to continue buying a new one every 2 years, to me it's worth it. The time and effort it saves us cleaning our house is worth the price.
<br>
<br>There's one thing that made me nix 1 star from this robo-vac: I wish it was easier to clean its wheels and around the wheels.

It has so many features, you can put it on a schedule to run on it's own, and I love when the battery is almost dead, it makes it's way back to the charger and connects itself back at home plate. If it gets hung up, i.e., caught under a table ledge, or maybe a recliner, it will keep beeping several times to let you know where he is, and that he needs unstuck. I love the price point for what you get. The more expensive ones, per my sis n law, do no better, and maybe not as well. I do keep it cleaned out 2 or 3 times during one running, but that's about a 2 to 3 hr run time each go. You won't believe the dirt that it pulls even after you just vacuumed and thought you got it all, it's awesome. Also helps grab rug lint that regular vac doesnt get. Esp new rugs. Just clean roller as needed.
<br>I bought another one for our winter home. You wont regret grabbing one. If I miss a day or so with my dyson, he picks up the slack with NO PROBLEM AT ALL. Review is longer. But I can't say enough about it. I love it. I clean the tray, as well as, the roller each time. It helps him keep his ""King"" status going. 😊 I also have 2 German shepherds that love him as well.",是,5,Fwinnie,2022-02-19

When I housesit, my allergies do not bother me like they did before the purchase. The other has carpeting throughout and a dog. She noticed that it was not as efficient on med. Pile carpet, but good enough for upstairs bedrooms. I am so glad that both machines are still working well! I also purchased the replacement parts for them which was very welcome. I witnessed the floor vac at work yesterday. It did not go under the dining room table with 6 chairs and had to be retrieved once from my daughter's major cord clump. Lasted over 60 min. And redocked without problem with 4"" clearance on the sides. In fact, I decided to buy one for myself

US,B079QYYGF1,R18VS1IM6AL3OP,Good for daily vacuuming but not perfect,Color:Black,"This is my first robovac so I have nothing to compare against. We have a small short haired dog and a child in our house. We bought this to vacuum daily all the pet hair, dust and crumbs that accumulate. This is strong enough to do just that and it does a great job with some limitations. You will need to make sure cords and other small items you don’t want the vacuum to grab or drag around are off the floor. This can be somewhat of a chore to remember and do. You will also want to watch the vacuum work a few times and identify any problem areas in your house where it can get stuck. We have an open floor plan house that is around 1380 sq feet and the vacuum can hit the whole house on one charge but usually requires some assistance to cover everything. If left alone without assistance it still gets pretty close to full coverage despite the redundancy. We are very pleased with our purchase. It’s not perfect but has made our house MUCH cleaner day to day. In fact we don’t use our other vacuum much anymore. I love the remote…the ability to vacuum with a remote control is just cool. Plan on emptying the dust tray almost daily. You will also need to clear the brush of hair and carpet fuzz often to ensure good performance.",是,4,Mixed Signal Design,2022-02-19

Yes it gets stuck on certain low-lying cords, rug tassels, and knocks over the cat food dish if I forget to put it up. With a few adjustments here and there before running, I will still say clicking run is easier than running a stick vacuum around the house.

It is ugly and tacky looking for a $200 purchase to be junked up like that. It is plugged in now for first charge. I guess I’ll tackle it with goop off if it charges ok and works, but NOT HAPPY with that ugly sticker. The first one I bought had that removable cling kind of sticker, not this tackiness. I know from experience goop off will leave marks and dull smudges even if I manage to get the sticker off.

US,B07R295MLS,R1HWH36L9328UE,Might as well just vacuum manually,Color:Black,"Really disappointed. If people still remember the motorised plastic balls with a fuzzy rodent like thing attached… that’s basically what this “vacuum” is. It wanders around, can’t find its own home changing base without being picked up and directed 80% of the time and has a fetish for getting tangled in any cord you own.
<br>
<br>If you haven’t had kids, welcome to parenthood because this thing is a toddler that gets stuck and beeps because it’s tangled in expensive electronic charging cables or is busy destroying your sweatshirt that happened to have an arm hanging over the couch.
<br>
<br>When I say “this thing sucks” it is not an endorsement of its vacuuming ability. It is terrible. It’s been two months. I want to love it, but I can’t. It picks up litter and cat hair— when I use the remote to direct it to do so.
<br>
<br>As much as I wish it wasn’t true, if you want to have a robot clean the house effectively either hire Rosie from the Jetsons or be ready to pay a lot more. This was a “too good to be true” price for a pretty disappointing product.",是,2,M,2022-02-16

<br>Keep it clean! I use the dust buster to vacuum the filters between changes. Watch your brushes, wipe your dust cup and your lens, and respect the limitations of these very reliable machines.

<br>I was envisioning being able to to run the vacuum while I was at work, making life easier. Unfortunately, it gets hung up on everything. I have hardwood floors with a few area rugs. It constantly gets hung up on the rug transition. I have to spend time prepping the house just to run the thing, then follow it around since it gets stuck everywhere. That being said, it has not made life easier, but it does a really nice job cleaning.
<br>I’ve only used the manual/auto clean function. But, now it has decided to turn itself on at 5am, wake everyone up, and start cleaning. It has done this two nights in a row, so I guess I’ll have to power it down and unplug it if we plan to get a full nights sleep.
<br>I had high hopes, but realistically I can vacuum/swiffer my floors much quicker on my own than the process of using this Eufy.
<br>Pros-good suction and does clean well. It can get to hard to reach areas like under beds.

The positive: this thing sure can pick up dust and cat hair. The cons: if you have cats or long hair shedding people the brushes will NEED to be cleaned after each use; it isn’t very smart and will bounce around the same area for a long time; it will get jammed up on any loose wires, blankets hanging off a couch or scrap of paper in the floor-basically anything that isn’t hair or dirt; it needs a fair amount of room around it for the dock. Basically, In my house, I can’t let it run automatically because it will get stuck on something or the collection basket will get full. It also can’t move doors to clean behind them.
<br>
<br>Who is it for? Well, we still use it. I just have to tidy up a bit before turning it on and I can do other things while it runs.

It does as fine as I’d hope for with our dog hair and on both hard surfaces and carpet. The hair that gets stuck in the rollers and wheels isn’t any worse than my other vacuums, and it’s easy to clean out. The only other issue we have with it is that it will get itself stuck if there are 3-way enclosed spaces or tight nooks. It doesn’t know how to back itself out of these situations, so it will either spin in circles untiringly or stop itself and beep loudly for assistance. This doesn’t happen all the time, so it’s only a minor issue. I still recommend this robovac completely.",是,5,Paul Peterson,2022-02-10

US,B079QYYGF1,R22Y0AQ5ZYBFEY,Good value for the price but could be better,Color:Black,This is the first robot vacuum I've bought. I have a long haired dog that sheds a lot and a cat so was looking for something to supplement my weekly vacuuming. I will say it this works well with cleaning up on my laminate floor (which is 80% of my house) but lacks good suction on some of my higher pill rugs. I've also noticed it missing certain areas of my floor and goes in very sporadic patterns. I have yet to play with the different settings and maybe it will take a few uses to get used to the layout of my house. I love that it goes underneath my furniture. That alone is worth the price for me. Runs for about 90 min before returning to it's charging dock.,是,4,C Tuma,2022-02-10

It means that every day after it finishes vacuuming I have to pull off the roll of hair from the brush spindle and take the vacuumed stuff from around the wires....most unsatisfactory - and each day it comes on again, perfectly clean, and proceeds to do the same thing.

US,B07R295MLS,R2C0SM5725EH41,Entertaining and efficient,Color:Black,"Love my new Eufy. My boyfriend bought it for me when I moved into my new one-floor apartment. It does an excellent job of picking up dust, cat hair, my hair, etc... Good, compact size so that it is able to move around under most things. If it gets stuck it beeps a couple of times then shuts off if you don't go pull it out from under furniture. I don't vacuum at all other than using Eufy once every two days or so. Emptying the trash collector is really easy, just push a button and pull the slot out. As any vacuum, hair gets stuck in the wheel but can be cut out pretty easily.
<br>
<br>The only drawback is that Eufy manages to find every cable that's on the ground. But this is discussed in the instructions when the item is received and it actually comes with some ties to tie up the cords laying around. This isn't really an issue for me as it would be the same with any vacuum, just something to watch out for.

US,B07R295MLS,R30HD0SA6Q8MKI,6 months into this experiment,Color:Black,"I wanted to test drive a robot vacuum and see how it would actually work and I saw this one for under $200 and thought I would give it a go. Here goes:
<br>1. It’s short…and that is good for getting under chairs, etc that were too low for more expensive robovacs.
<br>2. It picked up a ton of hair and dirt. Let me say this though…it seems to do MUCH BETTER on carpet than hardwood. Some of the material picked up is carpet/rug fibers. Especially at the beginning, I was very impressed with the amount of debris it got, however, 6 months in, I’m not as impressed. We have a black lab and I can literally use the remote to steer it back and forth over loose hair on hardwood and the brushes will move them around but they don’t get sucked up into it. It doesn’t matter what setting I have it on…the hairs on hardwood win. Disappointed.
<br>3. It is not a smart robot. Now, I know that it is not advertised as working with an app…what I mean is this little sucker basically drives around and bangs his way through your house. It may detect something simple and turn around or it may find a wall/lamp and bang it’s head on it like it’s in a mosh pit. It will climb up on lamp bases and hump those things like a randy chihuahua. Do you have a stray cable that it got access to…forget about it…there is no detection or stopping. It’s sucking that thing up and dragging whatever is attached for a ride. Part of the problem with the bumping along is that it will absolutely scrape the paint off of some 1/4 round molding. If it doesn’t, it will leave plastic on it.
<br>4. At least it was cheap. I have used expensive, programmable Roomba vacs and this. For the price, it’s a good first investment, but don’t expect miracles. You have to find what it does well and help it and determine what it sucks at and adapt your place for it.
<br>5. It finds its way home…mostly. The biggest issue is when it wedges itself under a bookshelf or between a chair and table.
<br>6. Would I buy again…maybe, but I’m now leaning toward investing in a Shark and seeing what it can do. With the limitations this robot has, I can’t leave our doors open and let it vacuum the whole house. It doesn’t like rugs, cables, stray strings, and many other objects that will be in the average home, so we robot-proof the place each morning before we leave so that it does a basic job of getting Mike’s hair up in a decent chunk of the house. With the Roomba, we could map the house and it didn’t have as many hang-ups.
<br>
<br>If we are having suction issues at about 6 months, I’m not sure what the expected longevity with this thing is here. We will see. We have replaced filters and brushes multiple times, so that isn’t it. It may just be the nature of the beast.",是,4,J. Glasgow,2022-01-30

US,B079QYYGF1,R12R2MLGL7Z8GS,Truly impressed with this little bot,Color:Black,"I don't generally write Amazon reviews, but this little robot deserves one. We just received ours yesterday, so I can't yet speak to its longevity, but I am even happier with it than I thought I'd be (though let's be honest, we've already started calling it a ""him"" and named it Rambo. *sigh*), and even my skeptic husband is impressed.
<br>We have a 2100sq ft single story home, primarily brick floors, with tile in bathrooms and several area rugs of varying heights. This little thing navigated almost everything all by itself, including under most furniture items (it got itself underneath our sectional couch, cleaned under there, and got back out over a rug by itself) with ease. I am most impressed by its edge-cleaning abilities, where the dust bunnies and pet hair really build up. I also like that it doesn't bang into things -- its sensor turns it before it actually bumps into most objects.
<br>Some areas where it struggled:
<br>1) It did get stuck on our hallway runner that has small thin tassels on the ends, but was able to navigate our jute rug that has large tassels.
<br>2) As others have said, it struggles with dark-colored objects, so it got stuck under one part of the footboard of our bed which was too low for it to get under and too much in shadow for it to ""see"".
<br>3) It also does struggle with cords and cables, but the seller provides ties to get them up out of the way.
<br>4) It was able to get on top of our 2 thick, high pile rugs just fine (not sure how successfully it's cleaning them, but it gets the top layer of pet hair off, at least) but the thin/lightweight rugs that have a border seem to give it trouble because it flips the edge up and then sometimes can't get over it. If it goes onto the rug at a more oblique angle it seems to be able to do it.
<br>I would say it picks up the same size chunks as a regular vacuum with a spinning brush does. It picked up the visible junk on the floor, TONS of dust and pet hair (had to empty it several times because it got into those crannies that I usually ignore, lol), and dog kibbles, but it couldn't pick up a nickel-sized plastic chunk from a dog toy. All about the same as our regular vacuum, but this time I didn't have to do anything.

<br>
<br>I didn't much care about the flying cars that folded to the size of a briefcase, or the jetpacks, or the jet-powered skateboards. But the automation of the grind of daily drudgery and obligatory ablutions – that was something I allowed myself to dream about as part of a relaxed and leisurely future.
<br>
<br>Enter, here in real life, the robot vacuum. Could something the size and shape of a frisbee make any appreciable difference in the amount of energy expended in housekeeping? Could it put idleness within reach of the average citizen?
<br>
<br>I wasn't convinced. I held off for years in purchasing one, thwarted by a lack of faith, a skeptical resignation, an anticipation of disappointment.
<br>
<br>But then, through some strange grace, I opened to a hope I had hitherto refused. I put the eufy in my shopping cart (I wanted to give a lesser-known a chance, so I forwent its more famous counterpart), where it stayed for months while I grew enough in my faith and courage to progress to the checkout. Then – at last – I chose my payment method and, with a vigilant optimism, placed my order.

Don't know if it was the charging unit or that the problem was with the robovac itself. I tried all the self diagnosis steps outlined in the manual but to no avail. I did get the unit to work for 30 minutes. During that time, the robovac seemed to work OK. I suspect that the appliance may have been a previously returned item as the packaging appeared to have been tampered with.

<br>
<br>Because it’s round &amp; automated, it doesn’t do corners &amp; edges well so I would still need to vacuum myself whenever I want a full room deep clean, but watching it work I think this a ‘problem’ I would have with any similar product.
<br>
<br>Also like any vacuum ever, hair does get caught on the roller which is not the funnest thing to get off. Personally I recommend a squeegee (yes the thing you use on windshields), a pet hair remover, or just rubbing your foot in circles on the carpet in places you expect to find a lot of hair.
<br>
<br>I think the biggest con (and again would be for any similar product) is it really needs some room to work, so it’s not ideal for small rooms with a lot of stuff. So for my bedroom I only use it after I’ve really cleaned up my room (a rare occasion). If we can be good about picking up cords and paperwork (or other things you don’t want any vacuum getting), then i think it’s be a good daily tool for the living and dining room.",是,4,Isabella West,2022-01-24

We named it Wally and runs all over the house like a pin ball for about 2.5hrs on each charge and recharges for about 3hrs or so. Picks up a lot more than I expected. It runs all over since it doesn’t have mapping capabilities. Beeps when it gets stuck or sucks up a foreign object like shoe laces, thin headphones wire etc. And when battery is about to run out it finds the charging station and docs itself.
<br>Cons: I have to regularly clean the brush and whiskers and remove long hair stands that get wrapped up on it. Whiskers could be made of a more resistant material since they bend quite a bit. I just switch positions from time to time.

It does a great job of sensing edges and stairs and has no trouble going from hardwood to carpet or over a cable hider. You will probably need to watch it run the first time and see if there is anything around your room that needs to be picked up or blocked off for future cleanings. For me, this was loose cables and the underside of my desk where it will get stuck. Has done a superb job of keeping my floor's dog hair and dirt/dust-free. The higher suction mode is great if you want a deeper cleaning and don't care about the extra volume. It lacks some of the higher-end features like phone connectivity, manual control, area mapping, etc but those are all not really needed imo and for its price of ~$200, it's a great pick up.
<br>
<br>The only ""issue"" after almost a year of use (I say this because it wasn't really a fault of the vacuum) I have had with it was a metal screw getting stuck between an edge sensor/bumper and the body and I had to partially disassemble it and do quite a bit of shaking to free it.

If you have pets this is great for picking up the hair every day. We have a large dog and a cat and after several days of running it we have noticed WAY less hair around the house. Its quiet while running and seems to not get stuck frequently. You do have to empty the dust bin after every run but, again for what i paid, worth it! You can set it on an auto run schedule using the remote which is very nice to be able to do! The sensors do a great job and it appears (looking at the tracks after its done) to get the whole house but while vaccuuming it can appear random for sure!

But that seems to be par for the course with most of the robot vacuums I’ve seen or used. I’m always amazed at how much dust this thing picks up even while running it regularly! I’m writing this review several months after opening it. One day it stopped working and the tech-support team was wonderful. They tried to troubleshoot it with me on the phone and when that didn’t work they had me send in the unit and they replaced it without a cost. Definitely recommended!,是,5,Jeremy,2022-01-20

It worked 7/10 but that was amazing given how little dog hair collected. It kept the rugs clean and the hard floors clean. You had to empty it everyday but that is to be expected and it would get stuck in rooms and couldn't find its way home but non of that was a bad thing. If I still had it I would love it, and I write this review cause I kind of what another but. It broke the first time. The front wheel which pivots and just supports the bot would fall out and it would get stuck very very quickly. Had them warranty it and that was hassle free, I had to mail the oil one back and they sent me a new one. Then after a month or so, the second one started making a bunch of noise, and wasn't moving correctly all the time.

My house is carpeted I have cats and my cats leave treat crumbs and little bits everywhere and it drives me crazy during the week and I can't vacuum everyday I just don't have the time. I know it's not deep cleaning because I've seen what my Shark vacuum picks up however it makes my carpets look presentable as far as if anybody came over my carpets look clean. I found that it seems to work best if I stick it in a specific room and block off the doorway and let it do that room and then empty it and then put it in another bedroom and block off the doorway and do the same thing and then what I'll do is I'll let it do the main living area.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2DG3R6C4T0XEI,This works!,Color:Black,"This was my first robot vacuum cleaner so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in one until I had tried one to see if the concept worked for me. This model had good reviews and went on sale so that enticed me to dive in and try it. Overall, I am very pleased. I will tell you that just the fact that this (and other robot vacuums) gets under your bed and under most furniture makes it worthwhile. But I will say that after using this particular model for about 8 months, there are a couple of features I would be looking for in the next model I buy. First of all, the way the brush is designed, items like thread and hair wrap around the very small section between the brush and the end and it's very difficult to get the hair/thread off. I wish that they had removable ends which would allow you to slide it off. Second of all, I wish it had capability for smarter programming. I have a very open floor plan in my house and one area has an area rug that this vacuum can clean well but it's too high for the vacuum to get back on to the rug after it gets off of the run. And this area rug is honestly the area that needs the most constant vacuuming so it would be desirable for me to be able to program the vacuum to stay on the area rug. I am not sure that any other vacuum would address these concerns because I haven't started looking. But I will say that I will be looking at future vacuums through the lens of these two features. Overall, though, I am super pleased with the purchase and experience.",是,4,Nina,2022-01-19

US,B079QYYGF1,RFBVJV8S9IBWU,"Might work for your circumstance, didn't work for mine",Color:Black,"This is a pretty basic robo vac in terms of features. It pretty much goes around in a random pattern like the early Roombas of the 2010's. The suction is decently strong given its profile. It's a fairly svelte vac which helps in getting underneath tight spaces.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem I had was that it would frequently get stuck and then would go into a feedback loop. For example, it wasn't able to transverse a 5/8"" border guard, eventually getting stuck. After repositioning in a clear area, it would go around and around in circles and then shut off again after about 10 seconds. The only way to clear the error was to return the vac to its base. Since I have several border guards in my house, the vac was impractical to use.
<br>
<br>In contrast, my Roomba j7 was able to transverse all but one of the guards, and even that one, it was able to back off and continue on.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, this vac may work for you if you have a fairly standard home without too many floor interface changes. It didn't work for me, hence the low rating. I don't regret trying it out given the price point.",是,2,Tonisama,2022-01-19

It crossed some rooms at odd angles, and never did cover some areas. Seemed to do an okay job on hardwood floors.

US,B079QYYGF1,R2R90THOH4RSBT,Cleans my hardwood and tile floors great. Effectively picks up my dogs short hair.,Color:Black,"This does the job well. We have a 90 pound mix breed dog that sheds lots of short hair (his hair is about 1/2 to 3/4 inch long). We've owned this for 3 months now and have used it on almost a daily basis.
<br>
<br>I use this primarily on hardwoods and tile. We do have some area rugs (these are woven rugs with ""fringe"") and door mats that it cleans well enough. It climbs up and over the edges of these without trouble. Occasionally it will linger on some fringe of one of our area rugs. If you have rare oriental rugs of value that could be a problem. The device's low height gets under almost all of our furniture. It has gotten stuck under one of our tables that has angled legs. It stops vacuuming and makes a beeping noise to alert us when it becomes stuck. I place a heavy book in front of this opening to solve that problem. Do make sure all electrical wires are secured or up and out of its way or it may pull a lighter device (like a mobile phone) off your tables.
<br>
<br>On regular random cleaning it will run for almost 2.5 hours when new. If you use the edge cleaning it does drain the battery quicker. I usually set it to run in a room for 15-20 minutes (depending on size of the room) and return to run it on edge mode once around the room. Then I move it to the next room. Using this method I clean my entire main floor (six ""rooms"" totaling about 1800 square feet) in about 2 hours. At that point the battery is usually about out (due to using the higher powered edge mode in each room).
<br>
<br>The battery is replaceable as are the brushes and filters. The replacement parts are reasonably priced imho.
<br>
<br>I do wish the dust collector was bigger but then the vacuum would have to be bigger. This design strikes the perfect balance in my opinion. With daily use I only have to empty it daily or every other day. If I skip a day or so I may have to empty the bin before it cleans the entire main floor.
<br>
<br>You can set it to run at a specific time every day. It would be nice to run it 3 times a week but the programming only allows once daily scheduling. It does have a ""spot cleaning"" setting that works well for when a planter gets knocked over and the like.
<br>
<br>My wife and I used to pay for a cleaning company every two weeks but this has allowed us to cancel that service. This keeps our floors clean on a daily basis and we handle the other cleaning chores every couple of weeks on our own. This vacuum costs less than what we used to pay for one visit from the cleaners. Frankly, we clean the rest of our house better than the pros did.
<br>
<br>It's quiet enough to use while watching TV or listening to music. It's no louder than our dish and laundry machines. I just turn up the sound a few clicks and go about my day to day activities.
<br>
<br>It's very easy to empty this vacuum and to keep it clean. I wish I'd considered buying one of these earlier. For the price I'm very happy with this vacuum.",是,5,pharmdeity,2022-01-17

US,B079QYYGF1,R1WRGZUF6L41YH,I loved it at first,Color:Black,"I am disappointed For the first 6 months I was in love. This is my first robot vacuum and I loved walking in and feeling like I had a maid come through and vacuum for us.
<br>Then, for some reason it stared getting stuck underneath my couch when it never did that before. I ended up blocking the 2 entrances for it and it stopped for about a month. Then it found another spot of the couch that it could shove itself under. I put a bunch of black towels under my couch to prevent it from doing it again but the aesthetic is so wrong now. And it REALLY wedges itself in there, which makes no sense to me because it barely allows itself to go along the corners of the wall.
<br>I bought it May 2021 and now Jan 2022 I’m pretty annoyed with it, very disappointing as I really expected it to last much longer than 6 months(when I started having issues.
<br>And I followed all of the directions. Clean it with a damp paper towel every other day, empty it out nightly, and deep clean monthly. I go with my Dyson every Sunday to pick up what’s left, and each month it’s more and more like the Eufy didn’t even do anything that week.
<br>I tried changing out the parts that were included and that really did nothing.Now I'm turning it on a second time (it auto cleans at 10am and I make it clean again at 10pm) and really it still makes no difference. It used to leave vacuum lines on the carpet, and now it’s like it didn’t vacuum the house. And mind you, it only vacuums my small living room and kitchen floor.
<br>In my opinion, it was a waste of money. It doesn’t live up to the expectations of when I first got it.

US,B07R295MLS,RQ9JG6BER8B48,"Well worth the money for saving time, energy, and effort",Color:Black,"This (really long) review is for the Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum (Robovac). Please note “Max” vs regular 11S. They may look the same; but the Max uses a different filter and has the higher 2000pa suction. Otherwise the functions and options (other than suction choices) are the same. I've used the 11S Max for the last month on my low pile carpet (about 80% of the roaming area) with the rest being tile or linoleum flooring. It has been quite fascinating to watch so I've actually put about 85-90 charge cycles on the unit over the last month (yes, three times a day on most days and it's still finding more dirt/dust than I would expect).
<br>
<br>Right up front, I'd definitely buy another when it comes time to replace this one. After comparing how I vacuum my flooring, especially to pick up my biggest carpet enemy; short stray bits of dried grass stems, the “random” wandering of this vacuum model made more sense to me than the other fancier choices. Most vacs do a good job with dust, dirt, sand, cheerios, etc. but these stem pieces are only picked up by a vacuum when it comes at the stem with the brush roller pretty much parallel to the stem. That means random directions will more likely get these pesky problems than an organized back &amp; forth cleaning approach. Granted it may take a few cleaning cycles or several passes over the same area during one cycle; but since the Robovac has completed its first 5-6 cycles I rarely find them anymore or if I do spot one it's not for very long.
<br>
<br>Robovac is a big time saver as well as an energy saver for me. I would use my canister vacuum about an hour each week for routine cleaning and once a month for 2+ hours to do a more thorough cleaning. A watt-hour meter indicated that my canister vacuum used 5-6 kw-hr of electricity each month. Robovac uses about 12 watts continuously for about 4 hours when charging (surprisingly less than the 5-6 hrs listed in the manual; but it is brand new). Once the battery is charged, the power consumption drops to about ½ watt. When Robovac is away cleaning, the charging base uses just ¼ watt for the homing beacon. So if used just once a day; Robovac would only use about 60 watts per day. That means once-a-day cleaning would only use 1.8 Kw-hr energy per month. By letting Robovac take over the regular weekly cleaning with once a day operation (or less), I'm able to cut my electric bill by an easy 3-4 kw-hr/month.
<br>
<br>With that said, there are a few things that I think need improved:
<br>
<br>First, there should be an interlock on the dust bin – Robovac will merrily go off about it's scheduled cleaning cycle without the bin installed! So if removed for emptying; don't forget to re-install the bin before the next scheduled operation. Plus, I noticed on a couple occasions, that I wasn't paying attention and I left one corner was about 1/8” out from fully inserted. Not sure if that will cause suction leaks; but you need to make sure the bin is completely inserted.
<br>
<br>Second, you can't select “max” (or any power level) when using the remote to manually clean an area. It appears to only operate on “standard” suction with manual operation (i.e., when Robovac is not running a regular cleaning mode and you chose to override it's direction). In addition, if you select the remotes' edge or spot cleaning modes it will automatically go to “max” power for the duration of that mode and you can't choose IQBoost or standard power level on those selections.
<br>
<br>Third, I don't know why the 20 minutes for edge cleaning or 30 minutes for quick cleaning was selected. Robovac can make it about 60-70% around my home in the 20 minutes of edge cleaning. If edge cleaning mode was permitted to run until it made a trip all way around and back to the charging station where it could dock to finish that mode would work better. An alternate solution would be if I could set the cycle time for edge cleaning and quick cleaning modes. Plus I'd like having an option for it to simply stop when the time is up rather than automatically returning to the base. When I want just one room cleaned; I'll set Robovac to auto or quick mode in that room, then close the door or put down a barrier, and return later to stop it manually and take it back to the charging base. If I don't return in a timely manner Robovac will be trying to locate the charging base and running the battery down.
<br>
<br>Fourth, Robovac cleans edges using only its right side pretty much all of the time. It would be helpful to have it randomly choose using either the right or left side whenever edge cleaning. I watched it edge clean a carpet/wall area three times going only in a counterclockwise direction (right side) and it still didn't pick up all the dust bunnies. I used manual control with it hugging the wall on its left side and it picked them up with no problem. Also, be aware that manual operation, when Robovac is not already working in a selected cleaning mode (overriding current movement), only works while the remote buttons are pressed. Robovac stops all functions shortly after a button is released when used manually.
<br>
<br>Fifth, I really don't need to run Robovac on a daily schedule – there should be a weekly scheduling capability even for the least expensive robot vacuums. It shouldn't be that difficult or expensive to update this model to correct this issue. Even if it's the same set cleaning time, every day for the selected days; just give me the ability to schedule cleaning cycles one to seven times a week.
<br>
<br>Sixth, when the battery runs low, Robovac can take forever, if it makes it back at all, to the charging base. I will routinely go looking for it if I haven't seen it return within 10-15 minutes after the approximate cleaning time has passed. The age-old solution for solving a maze (your home from Robovacs' perspective) is to constantly follow along obstacles using just one side (Robovac does recognize when it's circling something like a coffee table and adjusts accordingly after a 360 degree rotation). This method is how Robovac tries getting closer to the charging station when it's more than about 15ft away and not in line-of-sight (the charging base emits an infrared signal for homing action – make sure you keep Robovacs' bumper and the base clean). Sometimes Robovac occasionally gets diverted or the software tells it to try something different) and it will go off in another (often wrong) direction (extremely frustrating!). I highly recommend observing Robovac perform it's return operation from various areas in your home. I ended up placing a 2x4 along the end legs of my sofa as Robovac was consistently going along the side skirt, under the skirt at front of the sofa, then around the front leg exiting the side of the skirt, and then heading straight across the room. It would then go thru three other rooms and come back to the sofa again. The 2x4 forced Robovac to continue edging under the sofa, along the back wall, and out the other end which has an end table that mimics the 2x4 at the opposite end. Before using the 2x4, Robovac took well over an hour to get back to the charging base (it eventually changes up it's routine, usually after three tries) and required 5 hrs to recharge. With the 2x4, Robovac has been able to get back from the far end of my house to the charging base in under 20 minutes very consistently. While the ability to improve Robovacs' return mode is really limited to what you can do, the key point I'm making here is that the battery will always give you more charge cycles (longer life) before needing replacement if you can get Robovac back to the charging base as soon possible.
<br>
<br>Seventh, pay attention to the thin rubber wiping strip on the brush guard. After 60+ cycles I noticed the ends of the thin rubber strip (about 1/16” of it's height) were tearing away. I believe this was most likely due to moving back and forth over edging from tile/linoleum to carpet or maybe due to the floor mounted furnace registers in my home. I simply trimmed the torn bits off to keep them from getting caught by the brush. After about 100 cycles I noted the rest of the 1/16” strip was now gone. This impacts the tile/linoleum cleaning far more than carpet; but it is something to watch for. I highly recommend checking the rubber strip during brush cleaning and purchasing a brush guard replacement as part of a maintenance set. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve the thickness or type of material used to prevent or at least reduce this problem occurring in the future.
<br>
<br>Next, a few helpful hints I've learned or didn't find in the owner's manual:
<br>
<br>The “bowl” shape on top of the charging base with the white LED is just right to hold the remote control, button-side up. However, I prefer to turn remote controls' button-side down to keep them cleaner so it's up to you if you use it or not.
<br>
<br>I've had a few occasions when Robovac actually bumped into the charging base so it was no longer sitting square against the wall. This will impact it's ability to find the base when the battery is low. I took a used rectangular-shaped one quart motor oil bottle from my recycling bin, cleaned it thoroughly, and filled it with sand. It's now a 3-4lb weight sitting on top of the charging base. I haven't had the base re-positioned since adding the weight. Normally Robovac does a good job avoiding the charging base; but not always.
<br>
<br>Robovac “parks” about 1/2” away from the charging base tower. If you are careful, you can swipe a cloth over the bumper sensors to clean off any surface dust that has collected (always seems to be some); however, be careful as Robovac might activate while you are doing this. You might also get a solid red indicator without any beeps. This error isn't described in the manual; but I've found if I just lift Robovac off the charging base for few seconds and then replace it, it will change back to the charging orange color. (I suspect the solid red indicates a sensor error) It's also quite easy to remove/replace the dust bin during charging. Unfortunately you will need to flip Robovac on it's back to remove/clean the side and roller brushes as well as the bottom IR sensors and charging contacts, so remember to turn Robovac off with the topside button before doing this or get used to it trying to start up while you are cleaning it. Also make sure the blue/orange indicator light is on when you reposition it on the base. Sometimes Robovac will remain off rather than return to charging mode.
<br>
<br>After two or three cleaning cycles I'll do a regular check on the all the brushes and swap left and right side brushes when they are re-installed; seems to straighten and make them work a little better, maybe last longer too.
<br>
<br>Oddly the remote control spot clean button symbol and the manual indicate a clockwise spiral for the cleaning operation; but when I've selected it, Robovac has always used a counterclockwise rotation.
<br>
<br>If the side brushes happen to “hang up” on something, Robovac will stop spinning them while it maneuvers around the obstacle and then restart the brushes when it thinks it is clear. Don't assume there's a problem when you see this unless Robovac beeps and the indicator turns red.
<br>
<br>The flat handle end of a spoon or fork works great for prying the filter free from the bin for cleaning. Every time I have tried using my fingers; it pops out tossing dust/lint everywhere.
<br>
<br>The IQBoost mode doesn't seem to change going from hard flooring to low pile carpet or vice versa in my home. I think this is because the low pile carpet just doesn't cause enough “drag” for it to recognize that it could adjust the suction level. (I'm still not clear as to whether there's just two suction levels or if Robovac can vary linearly between the two) While the manual indicates a 40 min run time in “max” mode with medium nap carpet, I'm obtaining about 60 minutes with my low nap carpet. I do find the “max” mode clearly picks up more dust. I ran Robovac 20+ times on IQ mode before switching to “max” for its scheduled operation. The filter has clearly shown a thicker layer of accumulation on the filter.
<br>
<br>When “max” mode is set as default you will occasionally hear the vacuum whining noise change briefly. Best I can figure is it's a software glitch where the IQBoost code tries to adjust the suction level; but then resets it to max. I normally hear this shortly after Robovac goes from one flooring type to another. It also occurs shortly after it starts it's routine.
<br>
<br>Robovac does not communicate back to the remote. So if for instance, you press edge cleaning and Robovac doesn't get the message, the remote will show it should be performing edge cleaning even though it's not. Similar situation when Robovac is recharging or is returning to recharge; the remote will still show it's in the selected cleaning mode rather than the “charging” icon. You simply have to pay attention that Robovac has recognized your command by a “beep”.
<br>
<br>I found using the basketball nozzle with my Ryobi P737 inflator does an excellent job cleaning the filter. It takes only a couple minutes to clean both the filter and the bin (outdoors of course!). The original filter has been cleaned well over 100 times now and other than being a little dingy it's still working great. This should help stretch the recommended replacement interval to more than 2 months compared to the recommended “tapping it” to clean. Do not use the “canned” compressed air as I frequently find it wets surfaces during extended spraying and the Robovac filter is a paper element.
<br>
<br>If you have a sofa, chair, etc, with stiff or heavy cloth skirting down to the floor; I suggest safety pinning up at least a foot or two of the skirting on an open side. When or if Robovac switches to using the proximity mode for cleaning AFTER it gets under the furniture, the skirt will appear like a wall and it will keep running around underneath the furniture until it switches to a collision mode where the weight of the skirt generally will not trip the bumper sensors and stop it from escaping.
<br>
<br>I'm glad I've used Robovac during the daytime so I could track it down and figure out what trouble it got into during its normal operation or when I expected it to be back at the charging base. The alarm beep sounds can easily be missed when it's far away from you. Plus, when it powers down after getting stuck can make it lot more challenging to find! It's a lot easier to locate when the vacuum sound is still going or even if it's just the quieter wheel motors running it around looking for the charging base.
<br>
<br>To wrap up my review. I've found Robovac to be a well built, nicely designed, and quite durable robot vacuum. The $160 price I paid is quite reasonable with excellent cleaning ability (given it has about 1/10 the suction of a typical canister vac). It has good battery run times (my mixed flooring on IQ mode lets Robovac run about 80-85 minutes before recharging), and it is a wonderful time and energy saver. If you've been thinking about a robot vacuum without all the extras (or just don't like vacuuming), the Eufy 11S Max is a great choice.",是,5,Andrew Bean,2022-01-13

US,B07R295MLS,RZHD5ARBXGH4R,This does NOT have wifi or scheduled cleaning,Color:Black,"We bought this vacuum in 2020 to replace a Eufy that died two years after purchase. I didn't realized that this model did not connect to wifi, and did not have any way to schedule how many times a week it ran. Therefore, it runs EVERY DAY. It's ok - it's still running, but every day seems a bit much, and since the first Eufy only lasted two years before it bit the dust (died), I'm actually surprised this one is still running.
<br>That said, my husband is still loyal to the brand (not terribly expensive as robovacs go) and we just ordered a NEW Eufy that DOES connect with wifi and the Eufy app on my phone. (We'll see how that goes)
<br>THAT said... aside from the 'every day' run I don't have too many complaints... except for the fact that at least once a week it gets itself stuck under the rocker of the wide-open rocking chair in the living room - actually, that happens MORE than once a week, and sometimes more than once a day! lol - or on the hearth of the fireplace (about a 1"" elevation from the hardwood floor).

US,B079QYYGF1,R1D46A9VHQW4GZ,Great customer service for a wonderful robot vacuum!,Color:Black,"Before I even write about the vacuum, I want to tell you about the fantastic customer service! I called the number on the bottom of the vacuum when I had a problem. Upon calling I was very quickly talking to an ACTUAL person... that wasn't reading a script! Agustin, the customer service representative was a joy to work with! After explaining the issue, Agustin listened to the vacuum via cellphone, made a quick diagnosis and within a few minutes he had a remedy for the issue, going above and beyond my expectations. I am very pleased with the outcome and would recommend that everyone work with this company and their products. It so incredibly wonderful to call a customer service number and talk with a human being that is not reading a script but instead stands behind their product and is actually working with you to make things work out well for everyone.
<br>
<br>Now, this little robovac is awesome! I like that it's not very loud and it's actually fun to watch. I hate the chore of vacuuming and having this robovac set to vacuum each day at noon is a lifesaver for me. I don't have to vacuum and I don't have to remember to start this vacuum. At noon each day it zigzags all over the place and does a thorough job under the dining room table working around the table and chair legs. I use the one room clean feature to clean the bedrooms. I just make sure all cords, etc. are out of the way and let her work in the bedroom with the door closed. It does a great job of running along the baseboards and I couldn't be more pleased. I'm very happy with this product.
<br>
<br>The blue light on the vacuum and the light on the base are very bright. I like to keep my single floor home dark at night and the blue light and the base light really light the room up. If you want a nightlight of sorts, this is great. However, I'd prefer that it had a red light, a way to really dim the light or turn it off, or better yet, no light at all. That's just something for the makers to consider on future models. It doesn't stop me from giving this vacuum 5 stars. I love it!",否,5,RedHotMama,2022-01-09

US,B079QYYGF1,R2X07KNRJYH64C,"Wow, Just... Wow",Color:Black,"Picked this up on sale as a Christmas present and wish I had bought it long time ago.
<br>
<br>Our floors: Are a combination of hardwood, vinyl planks, and tile.
<br>
<br>Pets: Yes, small short haired dog
<br>
<br>Humans: Two (2), including a long haired female.
<br>
<br>Cleaning power: I used to vacuum once a week with a HEPA canister vac and thought I kept the house quite clean. Apparently I was wrong. We ran this daily for a week and continued to empty full canisters of dust, lint, pet hair, human hair, etc. from it. It gets under the beds, chairs and only gets stuck under the sofa bed since it's a wedge underneath. It rolls right over bath mats and tight weave rugs well enough and is able to get the edges and corners.
<br>
<br>Battery life: It's able to clean a 1600 sq/ft home with a single charge on the IQ power setting. If it appears to stay in a room longer than normal, we may send it back out after it recharges, which takes about an hour.
<br>
<br>Cleaning: Is simple, pull the canister, use the brush to clean the filters, give it a shake and send it back out. The included tool is useful for cutting the long human hairs it picks up which wrap around the whips or drum wheel. Either way, simple.
<br>
<br>Noise: We can hear it if it's in the room or the adjacent one, but once it makes its way down the hall, we can't hear it. It becomes unnoticeable after a while, even the dog ignores it now.
<br>
<br>Controls: We've really only used the Auto setting, not sure we'll ever need more.
<br>
<br>Value: Overall, I'd purchase it again, the joke in the family is now ""What did you do today? Well, I vacuumed... :-)""

Now that we have had it several weeks, it has started running without beeping, but it will sit in one place and spin and spin if it gets stuck (which is often). It is not getting stuck on things like cords, just in general locations that were never a problem for previous vacs. On max suction power, it picks up most hair and dirt, but doesn't last as long.

I was amazed at how much it picked up from my carpets and hardwood floors (and yes, if your floors are dirty you might have to empty it every 1-2 days but a heck of a lot better than hand vacuuming). It maps the area on it’s own very well and has a very sophisticated algorithm to do so. It can also get out of trouble if it get’s into a tight situation. It has only gotten stuck once and that was on a light weight throw mat. The only negative I see is that if you have a medium-thick floor rug, it can’t climb up on those. So I will end up using this one upstairs where I don’t have those rugs and find another one that can negotiate the large rugs downstairs. But for the price, can’t go wrong.

<br>No bluetooth, no wifi, no screen name/password, no mapping your demographics for sale to big brother. Thank you!!

<br>May wedge under tapered recliner underside legs or low furniture. I block with my boots or other objects.

<br>Goes under the bed or sofa, bumps around a bit, comes out the other side.

I know it’s the entry-level version that can’t be mapped but I didn’t realize that I would have to go on a treasure hunt for it every day to see where it has trapped itself.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3DT3FNF4NGHGN,It's a wayward toddler,Color:Black,"This vacuum's job is to clean out 750 square feet of hard surfaces on our main floor. I realize this model does not have a mapping feature. However, for some reason, it has developed a pattern that skips the most important rooms--kitchen, mud room, around the couch--and focuses on rooms we don't often use. It constantly gets stuck on the base of a large cat scratcher regardless of where I put it in our space--like it seeks the thing out. It's constantly getting stuck under our sectional against one leg, even though it has plenty of clearance otherwise and could turn or back up. When it's running, I have to follow it around half the time to get it unstuck, to block it, to turn it around and put it into the kitchen. This happens even when I chose the solo room setting. I swear it sees a mess, like cat litter around the litter box, and turns before it sweeps that up. It shipwrecks itself in corners and beeps incessantly. The filter is constantly getting clogged and it's REALLY noisy. If I didn't have to constantly supervise it, I'd put up with those things. It does a really good job with picking up cat hair. It's easy to clean, and I like that the beater brush comes out. But the front wheel gathers hair and grime and you can't take that out to clean it. Maybe I got a possessed model. Regardless, I'm returning this and just buying a more expensive model that makes a map and can be controlled via Bluetooth.",是,2,Lynn Clark,2022-01-01

I still deep clean the floors once a month or so but I do not feel overwhelmed anymore, or constantly feel like the floors are filthy.
<br>
<br>It does very well on hard floors and picks up all but the largest debris. You will need to keep stray items off the floor or it will get stuck. It fits nicely under my couches. We moved recently and now have very short carpet in areas. He does okay on carpet but not great.

<br>Customer service is fantastic which I value more than anything in a product, as issues are inevitable. Nothing is perfect.

<br>We have had Eufy 2.5 years and may need to replace it soon. Usually a good deep clean gets it past any funky behaviors but this time it's shorting out, not running at the correct time, and randomly cutting off. So for us the lifespan was 2.5 years and I feel like I got my money's worth.

I thought it was programmed to avoid falls, but this was down a long staircase as the ceilings downstairs are ten feet tall. I run it every few days downstairs.

Now, they’re but fond memories. I know it’s poor from to get your wife a vacuum cleaner for her birthday, but this was a hit. It does a great job for its purpose; we empty it every day, and every day it’s full of dust &amp; crumbs &amp; dog hair. You’d think it would eventually eliminate all caches but it keeps discovering new dirt. It intelligently avoids obstacles, rounds corners better than you’d imagine a circular disk could, has great battery life (~2hrs), is undaunted by our dark brown wood floor, gets under furniture we don’t usually vacuum. Full disclosure, I should say it is the bringer of death to Brio train communities. It is fascinating to watch and has made me its b**ch, as I’m now clearing shoes and toys in its path. Long term durability TBD, but 1 month in, problem free. If you keep the brushes clean and empty it, it should last. Hate to use a dad joke, but gotta say it, this vacuum sucks. (In a good way).

This is really the best thing that’s happened to household chores in some time. I did learn to keep cords out of the way and anything it can grab onto that would wear down the battery due to not letting go.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1J7R0QAJNM0UO,Cleans up a 4-cat household very well,Color:Black,"I bought my first eufy RoboVac 11S at a special price during Prime Day in July 2018 as a treat to myself because I work from home and hate vacuuming. It served my family well with regular running for 2 years. Around May 2021, I started noticing some rattling and clunking. We replaced just about everything that we could replace on it, but it's not as quiet as it once was because it has simply worn out. (I'm worn out just thinking of vacuuming for 1,300 hours like this little robot that could.) For Black Friday 2021, I bought a second eufy 11S at a special price and I'm setting up the new one today. I do want to point out specifically that it never stopped working...it's just gotten noisy because moving parts have worn out. It is worth buying a new one to me for less than $150 after almost 2.5 years of regular use, especially at less than half the cost of some of the more expensive robot vacuums. If you have a eufy that's making some noise, there are some great message boards and YouTube channels to diagnose and fix the issues. We replaced the sweeping brushes and filters multiple times. We replaced the central spinning brush, the brush cover, the filter cover, and the tires all once when trying to get rid of the extra noises, and these efforts did help well enough to use it for another 6 months. We never had to replace the battery. Regular maintenance makes a huge difference. The spinning brush will eventually get loose where the brush inserts into the body of the vacuum and make rattling noises. (Note that items can get stuck under the tires to create rattling noises as well, but the wheels are quite easy to remove. Not every rattle means it is worn out!)

First let me say it's not perfect it has its flaws. It will on your first few uses get stuck. It will be up to you to set up your space to ensure he does not get stuck every time. You will still have to do minor cleanup of big debri prior to letting your bot loose. I was able to do 3 Cleans in a day 1 scheduled at night and 2 throughout the day. Cleans for about an hour and 15 mins on boost iq. I have a 1400 Sq foot top floor and it Cleans about 1000 Sq ft of it in a single clean kitchen dining room hallway and living room. It picked up everything off my floors which really surprised me. Keep in mind, If you have high pile carpet this may not be for you. All in all paying 160 to have my bot vacuum for u a few times daily is worth it to me. No need for a big bulky vacuum anymore.",否,5,Stephen clarke,2021-12-22

US,B079QYYGF1,R2GEMC027P9HD5,Game changer for the lazy housekeeper,Color:Black,"I have had robotic vacuums for about 8 years. It was my 30th wedding anniversary present to myself. I started out buying Roomba products which are great but then I started giving these vacuums as gifts so wanted to try a less expensive brand. This one ROCKS. You can catch it on sale for around $150. Thats almost cheaper than a housekeeper. I have purchased 4 of these as gifts and so far everyone loves them. I have had vacuums with all the bells and whistles and frankly ended up not using them. I just clean one room a day. That way if the sucker gets stuck somewhere I can just vacuum again after I free it up. I NEVER get out my regular vacuum cause this one cleans WAY better and is much more thorough than doing it by hand.
<br>PROS:
<br>1. runs longer than most robotic vacuums
<br>2. can adjust suction power so if you are just cleaning a bare floor you can set it on low
<br>3. Has a remote to control suction and scheduling
<br>4. low profile so fits under most furniture
<br>5. Knows when it is on the wrong charger (oops my bad) it beeps
<br>6. Cleans under beds and couches that rarely if ever get cleaned under (scary how much it finds to pick up)
<br>
<br>CONS (minor would not stop me from buying it)
<br>1. No handle to pick it up
<br>2. Hepa filter is not as effective as Roomba
<br>3. Every time I used the remote it would somehow set the schedule for it to run at midnight so I just quit using the remote",否,5,Picasso,2021-12-21

The first incident, the eufy got stuck between a rug and the bathroom cabinet. It continually ran into the cabinet until all of the finish was removed from the cabinet and the wood was damaged. I would have thought the eufy would have signaled that it was stuck, but instead it would continually run into the cabinet. The second incident involved a shag rug. The circular brush got snagged on the rug and the eufy tried to keep going, again and again. I would have thought the eufy would have signaled that it was stuck but it just kept going for 10 minutes, pulling out the threads of the rug in the process. We try to baby sit the eufy so that it doesn't go on the rug, but every time we push it away, it just tries again. Which makes me wonder, why even use this product? We've had better luck with Roomba.

US,B079QYYGF1,R34BJ4R4TB2ABL,Replacing the Battery,Color:Black,"Just a couple of tips if you need to replace the battery. First, you'll need a VERY small phillips screwdriver to remove the 2 screws holding the battery cover in place! (I finally found one that came with the eyeglass repair kit that I have. None of the others I had on hand even came close!!) Needle nose pliers were also helpful in holding on to the base while removing the plug ... it doesn't disconnect all that easily. Also, there are wide white strips wrapped around the battery. I was inclined to remove them until I watched one of the battery replacement videos that are available on YouTube ... they're not meant to be removed. Why there's absolutely nothing in my Owner's Manual about changing the battery is beyond me ... what an oversight!
<br>
<br>FWIW, I have 3 (long-haired) Irish setters so all of the hair wrapped around the rolling brush needs to be removed after every use or I get 4 beeps indicating that the rolling brush is stuck. I bought extras so I don't have to clean my rolling brush every day ... I have 7 so it's a weekly chore! :-)",是,5,reddogs,2021-12-19

I also live in Florida so my backyard is basically all sand which is constantly tracked in by the dogs no matter how much I wipe their feet. This vacuum keeps my floor so clean.

<br>PRO:
<br>
<br>* Bargain Priced! Finally a reasonably priced robovac.
<br>* Suction! Strong suction power and has a boost feature. Great with pet hair.
<br>* Quiet! Much quieter than my previous unit.
<br>* Slim! Fits under more of my furniture and no more dust bunnies in hard to reach places.

US,B079QYYGF1,R4OCTZXWJ2UKP,This vacuum sucks,Color:Black,"As a vacuum cleaner, the Eufy 11S is not great. If you think of it as a carpet sweeper, you'll be happier. On my bedroom 3/8” pile carpet, it swept up dust, but not lint. It did a fine job on the entry mat near the back door, but that has no pile whatsoever.
<br>
<br>It's probably best to run this vacuum frequently to gather the surface dust and maybe any loose lint. On successive runs, it will gather dust it missed the first time. I ran it on a hardwood floor in one of the other bedrooms, and I was surprised how much dust it got on the 2nd day.
<br>
<br>You really need to robot-proof your room. The vacuum hates loose wires, like the ones you have behind the couch that are attached to the rear speakers. Any drapes or curtains need to be tied up so the vacuum does not get tangled. It has a problem with sloping surfaces, such as the rocking chair rockers or my clothes valet that has feet that slope to the floor. The area rug in my family room gave it a problem, since the combination of the rug and the mat was too high. The vacuum started to climb up onto the rug, then got stuck and could not go any further. When I vacuum this room, I take the rug off the mat, and that works.
<br>
<br>I would suggest you observe the vacuum in each room the first time to figure out what the obstacles will be.
<br>
<br>If you don't have any carpets or rugs, and you don't have a lot of stuff on the floor, this might be the right vacuum for you. It would be a definite time saver. But be sure to empty the dust bin often.
<br>
<br>The Eufy 11S is easy to use; the remote works just fine. The unit is easy to dismantle and clean. A small brush comes with the unit, but I found that an old toothbrush works even better.
<br>
<br>It never fell off the stair landing. It's quiet. I did not try the timed programming feature.
<br>
<br>This vacuum takes 4 or 5 hours to recharge, so you will have to manage that.
<br>
<br>Don't throw out your upright vacuum, since that will do a more thorough job on carpets and rugs with even a minimal pile. Don't throw out your shop vac, since you will need that for stairs. And you can use it to clean out the Eufy.
<br>
<br>When the Eufy 11S breaks, and it's out of warranty, I will not get it fixed. Maybe a different brand or model will work better. I would not buy this again.",是,3,Andrew N Schwartz,2021-12-17

<br>Cons: it's basically a battery-powered pinball. It doesn't establish a pattern so it can vacuum the same room for an hour and still leave crumbs all over because it's path is random. Totally random. Setting the physical boundaries is a pain, but I suppose that's with any robovac. It's loud on the regular setting; you can't run it while you're sleeping, no way. I have a toddler and a 7 year old, so the floor always has tons of crumbs...that's why I bought the robovac, I figure I'll let this thing sweep for me every day. Well - the spinning brushes spin so fast that most of the crumbs get scattered rather than swept up into the vacuum.

US,B079QYYGF1,R1FPWJ1MSKPLBY,We love our SAM!,Color:Black,"We got SAM our new eufy robot vacuum on a Cyber Monday. We currently use a Dyson V6 that I love, but we have 5 dogs and hair and dirt on our tile floors was inevitable and vacuuming daily was becoming too much. We saw the reviews, we liked the price and wanted something entry level to later upgrade if we needed to do a higher end model/brand.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-It’s light, and thin and fits under couches easily.
<br>-Cleans just as good as my Dyson on tile flooring!
<br>-Its noisy but not super loud, I’ve never had anything to compare it to, but I would say it’s in the middle scale. But I work from home and I can work perfectly with it in the background.
<br>-It does a great job of vacuuming my tile floors.
<br>-It’s user friendly, it doesn’t have a fancy app but the remote is fairly easy to use. I have it scheduled daily and can run it manually if I had to.
<br>-It finds its way out to tricky dinning tables and weird corners. And most importantly detects the ledge in my garage so it never falls down the step.
<br>-Decent capacity for dust bin and very easy to empty out and clean
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Cleans at random, there is no specific pattern it follows and there’s no way to block off an area if you wanted to. No fancy app to use.
<br>-Has gotten stuck on my rubber flip flops and struggles a tad bit over low pile carpet mats. Although it’s never actually gotten stuck on one yet.
<br>-Because I can’t block out a certain area I have to make sure there are no cables or shoes lying around each day.
<br>-It doesn’t empty it’s bin out automatically
<br>
<br>For the price point it really does a great job. I can’t expect a fancy app and a self emptying bin at the price. But noting if those are must haves for you. I love my Eufy and am so happy we decided on this model.

My 1000sq ft mostly carpeted (med pile) appartment. For 2 weeks this vacuum tended to my living space (which is the bulk of the appartment ~2/3) which is high traffic. Today I broke out the upright to see how well the robot did and was throughly impressed. On a weekly vacuum schedule I normally have to empty the canister twice when tending to the living space (cat fur, dust, dirt, ect). It did not even come close to filling up once, maybe 1/4 full.
<br>
<br>Pros - VERY quiet. My cat actually chases it around corners trying to play with it. Easy to clean the dust from the filters and empty. Does very well on med pile carpet and hard floor (idk how it would do on short/long pile). Picks up bigger stuff like pine needles.

So after one day of use, I was so frustrated with the stupid thing I wanted to throw it out the window. But instead, I boxed it back up and went to the order on Amazon to start the return. It then told me I needed to speak to customer service. So then I spent 20 minutes on the phone, getting transferred multiple times, only to eventually be told that this item is non-returnable.

<br>I own a yellow Lab, notorious breed for shedding hair all year long. I have ceramic tile floors with carpet in each bedroom.
<br>I send the Eufy every day to vacuum, it works great! The dust collector is always full of hair and dirt at the end of every cleaning. It's very quiet and covers the whole house. If I want to deep clean the carpets I just put the vac in the bedroom and close the door.
<br>tips:
<br>I have 4 bar stools in my kitchen and a small dining room table with 4 chairs.
<br>To keep the vac from getting stuck under the barstools, I used a strip of clear packing tape attached to two legs at the the base of each stool. Tuck the stools back in under the counter with tape side out and the vac will just bounce away! Or, just pull two stools out so the vac can escape!
<br>For the table, I just pull out one chair so the vac can escape from under the table.
<br>All in all I'm very happy with the vac, I highly recommend it!",是,5,Amazon Customer,2021-12-09

I felt it was an unaffordable luxury, but I couldn't resist the deal, and I couldn't be happier. I run it almost daily. It picks up an incredible amount of cat hair that I never knew was in my carpet. Works great for kitty litter on tile. Transitions very well from carpet to tile or to vinyl and vice versa. Goes over door mats and kitchen mats with no trouble. It does not have all the bells and whistles, but, again, I could not justify the ""luxury."" My upright Bissell is, of course, a much deeper clean, but for everyday use, this is the answer for me. It cleans with no rhyme or reason, but that does not bother me. If I need to direct it, I can use the remote. My long hair still wraps around the brush and requires manual cleaning, but very well worth that little effort to have my floors vacuumed, while I empty the dishwasher.

The biggest problem is that it started just going over the same areas time and time again. I closed off the kitchen and let it go and it literally took the same path for almost 30 minutes, leaving many places unvacuumed. We quit using it because it was so ineffective. I recently got it out again and put on new brushes, etc. It can go over the smallest thing (like a cracker crumb) and just spit it out. I checked to see if the cup was full, which it shouldn't have been as it had only been running a mere 15 minutes. It also still just goes over the same areas again and again, missing other areas completely and also not picking up some stuff it comes across. I have made sure it is clean and that it has new brushes but it doesn't seem to matter. Very disappointing and has made me hesitant to order another robo vac of any brand. I'd love to have one as it would save so much time to come home to clean floors. It's just me and my husband and now we have a dog, but we are all 3 outside of the house at work all day (the dog goes to work with my husband), so it should be able to operate better than it does.

One thing I have noticed is it hates the Roomba, when it gets a chance it will knock the Roomba base aside where the Roomba cannot dock. I think it was programmed to do that by Eufy.

US,B079QYYGF1,R3VULG4T9AV5SX,Just get it!,Color:Black,"I never thought I would go for a Robo type vacuum. But my daughter-in-law had this and I ordered one too. It works its way around the various rooms and then goes back to its charging base. I was amazed at how much it picks up. I have a cat, who follows Eufy around. It does a good job of cleaning up pet hair.",是,5,Jan,2021-12-04
US,B07R295MLS,R3NG3WPWWW9XPD,It's functional & fun...like a RC car for grownups.,Color:Black,"I have pets, so I have to empty the dirt reservoir every 10 minutes; but it is a lot of fun to use. It's very quiet, but my cat &amp; dog still want it dead. Very entertaining for a boring chore!",是,5,TJ,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,R2URBTHFQPDVR4,Easy to use robovac,Color:Black,"set up instructions are easy and very easy to use. Need space for docking. In terms of navigation, both do their jobs in an almost haphazard fashion. I would like to see them have an actual “dirt sensor” that would lead them toward areas with noticeable particles. The Roomba does have some sort of sensor as when it finds an especially dirty area it will swirl around it several times. The Eufy apparently has a mode where it applies extra suction, but I’m unsure if it automatically switches to this or if it has to be manually set to do so.",是,5,Madhusudhana Reddy Vallem,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,RTEZQ2LZSBID6,Helps alot with cleaning,Color:Black,"Pros:The directions are good and it's easy to navigate. It's not too loud. Cleaning it out is easy. Picks up well (not quite as good as a regular vaccum, so I have to go over rugs twice, but it's better on flooring)
<br>Negative: It takes a long time to fully charge (around 2.5 hrs.).",是,4,J.S.,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,R2Y3NWQCVNN89U,It does work.,Color:Black,"So I have two dogs, one of then is a hair and dirt ball! So tired of sleeping constantly because of her. This vaccum works pretty dang good for the price point. It picks up the floaty dog hair that always escapes my broom, and the dirt from them coming in and out of the house all day. Also saw reviews about it needing a ton of space to dock, I shared a picture of mine, it has about a foot on each side, and I have had no problems with it. So my the money, I give it 5 stars.",是,4,Amber,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,REDEJLLA01VFI,Decent product with serious flaw: Starts making so much noise you won't want to use it,Color:Black,"It vacuums pretty well, but there is a major flaw in the design or the quality of the parts. As others have noted, it's pretty quiet when new, but after a few months it will start making a horrible rattling sound which will make you not want to use it. To clean thoroughly, you have to let it putter and bump around for quite a while, so once it gets really noisy it will also start to drive you crazy.
<br>
<br>Eufy really needs to stand up and own this common issue / design flaw. Even if your vacuum is a little over a year old. It's stingy and irresponsible to have people discarding an otherwise good machine, battery, etc. Not to mention the obvious fact that those customers will likely look to a different brand in the future.",是,2,Canyon Man,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,R14VCDF3NDPQQB,Hit and miss,Color:Black,"Aimlessly vacuums. Will do the same place over and over, while missing a lot of areas. If you run it, charge it, and run it AGAIN, you might be able to not have to manually vacuum. So if you do that, running it twice and charging it, you are looking at like seven hours for it to do everything, since it has a charge for three or four hours.",是,2,Erin J Henriksen,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,RF7AU1ESJWNSY,This vacuum showed up defective. Amazon took responsibility.,Color:Black,"I recived this product and it did not work from the start. It could not run for more than about 98 seconds before getting stuck on open carpet or wood flooring almost as if it had no power. I tried litterally everything to get it to work and nothing changed. If the vacuum works it is probably amazing, but if it doesn't Anker seems to run you around in circles and eventually not answer. However amazon did take care of the problem and for that I am grateful. Just be careful dealing with this vacuum company and understand you will not have product support.",是,1,Joshua,2021-12-04
US,B079QYYGF1,R1BJNYAVWHHRN0,Eufy- amazing,Color:Black,So far love Eufy. I am amazed at how much fine dirt it picks up daily. I think it does better than any upright vacuum cleaner.,是,5,Kim Fiessinger,2021-12-03
US,B079QYYGF1,R22LS4RSF5S688,R u serious???!!!!,Color:Black,"OMG!!!!!
<br>
<br>I just gave my 700 sqft upstairs a good vacuuming last week.
<br>
<br>Then, I gave it a good carpet wash with my Hoover.
<br>
<br>After running this robot for 25 minutes, I got a beeping signal that it has stopped.
<br>
<br>It was already too full.
<br>
<br>I have a hound dog that sheds but not that dang much.
<br>
<br>Btw, I chose the EUFY because I have their VIDEO doorbell and absolutely love it without a fee every month.

It started having an issue but EUFY support team was incredibly responsive. I connected with Alexandra on the CSR team, and she was able to help resolve the issuing a replacement. She was great! It speaks to how well Eufy and Anker provide great customer support and is a big reason as to why I love their products.",是,5,DT,2021-12-03

US,B079QYYGF1,RAEOI89FUNHU,Great budget vacuum,Color:Black,"Just goes around randomly but is as simple as it gets. Press start and it cleans. Runs about an hour half to two hours. Cleans about 3000 square feet in that time. Highly recommended for a budget vacuum. Hardwood floors, carpet it handles it all. Very happy with purchase",是,5,Daniel Weinstein,2021-12-03
US,B079QYYGF1,R2UBVZ1OYOM6F2,So far so good!,Color:Black,Purchased as a black Friday deal. I didn’t want to invest in anything more expensive until I was sure how one of these would actually work in my first floor space &amp; after letting it run for one hour I am pleased with how much it was able to suck up. It only got stuck twice and that is to be expected my coffee table and my couches are just at the right height where if it comes in at an angle it can’t pass through. No big deal heard the beats was able to pick it up put it back out in the middle of the room and it went about its merry little way. Will update the review in a few weeks to let you know how things are going!,是,4,Brooke Smith,2021-12-03
US,B07R295MLS,R3GPYQOMVMLRE4,Good for a month,Color:Black,"I loved Eufy for the first month (July). But then, it stopped picking up as well. I was replacing the filter weekly. Took everything out, blew it out with an air hose…no help. I purchased and replaced the brush and side brushes, no help. And it just gets worse. Now, by December, it’s useless. It’s goes right over little things and doesn’t even pick it up. The filter completely clogs in the first 30 minutes.
<br>
<br>I highly don’t recommend.",是,1,J. Emro,2021-12-03
