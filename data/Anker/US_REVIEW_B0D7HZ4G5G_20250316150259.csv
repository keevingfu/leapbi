US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R39ETQSHQQIJBL,Reliable and lots of bang for your buck,Color: White,"Sleek design and very portable, all while having a huge tank capable of recharging my phone several times (maybe 2 times or even more). On top of that, it charges my iPhone 13 Pro very quickly. While it definitely is a little heavy in hand, it’s not really a downside at all, and still doesn’t fall off easily. It also charges wirelessly without MagSafe (it worked on my AirPods), although I’m unsure if it works with other products or nonApple devices.",是,5,Jeremy,2025-02-19
US,B0D7DKJ75M,R3QCJ6NLIHWFLA,Super versatile charger,Color: black,"My favorite power bank now. Light, compact, packs 10k mAh, and can attach to the phone. While on the go, I always plug in the phone with a short cable for maximum charging speed and efficiency, but the MagSafe option really helps when traveling: I can charge both with a single cable overnight. And if I ever need an emergency charge for my Macbook Air, it can also do that with 30W of power. Most versatile power bank I've ever had.",是,5,virusman,2025-02-18

Traveling from Switzerland, to France, to Belgium, to The Netherlands in one day by train. Total travels took 9 hours using the phone a lot to manage/purchase connections, view schedules, and listening to music along the way. This charger kept my iPhone 13 Mini full or nearly full the entire time. It was very reassuring knowing I would have good battery life, as some trains didn't have options for charging during the ride. Lack of cables was great for convenience.",是,5,Frank,2025-02-17
US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R2KLATVIC4SVXT,Small but mighty,Color: White,About as close to Apple OEM as you can get. Slim but packs a lot of power. Does warm up during charging but never too hot to hold. This is something you can carry in a bag or backpack everywhere. You almost forget it’s there until you need it. Wireless and wired charging are both super fast. Easy to recommend.,是,5,Alex,2025-02-15
US,B0D7DKJ75M,R1VPXQKA74XQ1K,Overall good product,Color: black,"I like how this is more slim than others and fits in my pocket much more comfortably. I've been using it for a few months now and travel a lot. It does get a bit warm when charging, nice hand warmer when it's cold. It recently seems to have issues charging. It only shows the first led light indicating a lower charge, but was still able to charge my phone fully. We'll see if it holds up, but does have me a little worried and not sure if i'd buy another.",是,4,Joe,2025-02-15

The wireless is great when I just want to have my phone on my table, not only that it's a soft rubbery feel so it won't scratch your phone.

It can get a little warm, but not too bad so far. Only thing I wish it had was a kickstand but that is not a deal breaker for me. I will likely find one to apply to the back of it.",是,5,Jennifer Oldham,2025-02-14

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R3FP9S7DSRCAUH,Perfect for people on the go or traveling,Color: White,"It was my first time using this power bank for my iPhone 16 Pro Max. 1st charge- my iPhone was at 20% battery, it charged up to 85% in 2 hours, still have 2 dots remaining. 2nd charge - my iPhone was at 19%, it charged only up to 72% in 1 hour 40 min., and then power bank is empty. I believe it will give my iPhone probably 1 full charge only with a tiny bit leftover power. It feels warm to touch, but no overheating. I can use my phone while charging if needed. The device is compact enough, and it doesn't feel bulky in my hand with the phone. The magnet is very secure with the MagSafe, and doesn't fall off easily. 1 full charge is all I need for my phone. It works great for my need. It would be better if it will indicate the % of power left, but if that would compromise the size and weight, I can do without.",是,5,Cesca,2025-02-04

If she's not in the car or at the office, she had limited access to a charging port or cable....hence the portable charger.

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R1SYG5SNL0J4UI,Disappointing: Slow charging and unusable while charging,Color: Black,"I bought this Anker MagGo Power Bank for a work conference, hoping for a convenient way to keep my phone charged. While it does charge, it's incredibly slow. But the biggest issue is that you can't actually use your phone while it's charging. I received multiple heat warnings when I tried to, which is a major concern. (See attached picture.)
<br>This defeats the purpose of a portable charger. I've never had this problem with a traditional power bank with a cable. It's a shame because the MagSafe feature is convenient, but the inability to use my phone while charging makes this product a no-go for me.",是,2,James,2025-01-27

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R30GPNHSQDT284,Extremely overheats worst origional.Qi2 very heavy,Color: White,"update 01/19/25 overheating within 3 minutes both 10,000 and 5,000, My opinion if buy either one o for 10,000 charged 90% faster , 5,000 charges 1% in 50 minutes . My 5,000 going back apple this week thinnest battery bank on market but there thin battery banks that much faster.
<br>Update: 01/17/25 10,000 slim well made strong magnets but heavy in pocket. I also received 5,000 slim from apple extremely slim amazing but has lot issues only charges 1% in 19 minutes and gets extremely hot there no way keep in pocket too hot. It's definitely thinnest on market it seems all Qi2 5,000 very slow and heat up crazy with few minutes .
<br>well made strong magnets , Charges fast first 10 minutes then iphones High temperature mode goes on , have remove magesafe 10 minutes it charges slowly . 10,000 well made but heavy keep in pocket
<br>Today received my anker slim and mean slim probably slimmest on Market . After 30 minutes 5,000 does get warm. But seeds same.as 10,000 . If need magsafe keep pocket try find 5,000 only buy apple.com or if get lucky apple store it's better option 10,000 less heat . probably 5,000 only get 50% better in pocket and comes with apple cable not cheap rubberlyike 10,000. For me 10,000 slim gets too hot and return it have original Anker Qi2 much weaker magnets but works and use 5,000 went out . I did take pics all 3 products . I would say if like apple magsafe buy 5,000 Qi2 gets warmer apple version . did partnership on 5,000 version only buy at apple. I have few magdafes from Anker , 5,000 esr stovetop like 10,000 slim , I also have 10,000 small company with Qi2 which faster only 39 . The positive on Anker 10,000 great magnets compare original always fell off, Burns up after 12 minutes that's con for me and well made heavy carry pocket.

While the Qi2 charging is a nice feature, I found charging via Qi was slower than expected and I'd rather just have a tethered external battery to charge with. The MagSafe magnet is not very strong and the added thickness of this battery makes it difficult to slide into your pants pocket without it detaching. I found it more convenient to carry in my jacket pocket or sling bag when using this. At the end of the day, if you don't mind how long it takes to charge this could be a good solution. I'd love this if Anker made it with a stronger MagSafe magnet and the unit were just a bit slimmer.",是,2,Steve L,2025-01-15

This has a nice soft touch on the top and a metallic contrasting shade along the sides. The battery is not too clunky but I did find mag-safe charging heated up the battery more than I liked.

My family absolutely loves it and uses it mainly as a backup battery for their Xbox controllers, which works perfectly. The ultra-slim design and MagSafe compatibility make it incredibly convenient, and the 10,000mAh capacity provides plenty of power. It charges quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Qi2-certified 15W fast charging. The ergonomic design is a nice bonus, making it easy to hold and use.

US,B0D7J24952,R94X1QGE548LS,Great built quality and function,Color: Green,"As a product, this looks and feels very premium. It just feels like a quality product. I really like having this out with me and look to take it out to be used. The function is as expected with any of the magnetic battery power banks. As soon as I connect it to my phones, it'll charge correctly. The magnets are strong, and I have not had any issues with it. All my phones have the magnetic ring on the cases as well. It does charge quickly for magsafe at 15W. I was able to notice a difference on this with the iPhone 16 versus an older magsafe charger that was only 10W. Also, this was definitely thinner than the older battery with the same 10,000mAh capacity. Also, it charges up very quickly as well since it's able to charge at a pretty high rating of 30W.",否,5,Joel,2025-01-10
US,B0D7J24952,R28J159L60HCRU,Slim and charges quickly,Color: Green,"The form factor of this charger is pretty sleek, even on my iPhone 13 mini (though of course it's going to look even better hanging off the back of a regular or max iPhone). Charges quickly via convenient USB-C, and doesn't have a bunch of nooks and crannies that collect dirt if you put it in a bag or pocket. Great for topping off the airpods case as well. Best of all, visually it's pretty complementary to the aesthetics of the Apple ecosystem, so nothing looks out of place.",否,5,Rachel,2025-01-10
US,B0D7J24952,RQ0P83ZAGR7HZ,Very disappointed,Color: Green,"Tested repeatedly and left my iPhone 13 Pro Max alone. There were no notifications or anything running in the background as I put it on airplane mode. Went from 57% to 65% in 17 mins on average. I need to keep it longer to test capacity. It is great to hold, and it charges in 2 hours, which for 10,000 mah is great. But since Anker claimed that this would charge 25% in 20 mins- I am now doubtful about any claim they make. This and the 3 in one are both disappointing. Previous power banks charged much faster via MagSafe even at 7.5 watts.

We always needed it mid day and we were both able to charge our phone to full and the Power Bank would still not be dead.

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R32RYMFTDSZV0J,"Very Handy, Especially for an Older iPhone",,"Overall, the Anker MagGo Power Bank does exactly what you would expect, and does it well. The capacity is enough to top up your phone after a day of heavy use and the slim form factor lets you put it in just about any pocket on your clothing or bag. It's even slim enough to keep on your phone while using it without sacrificing much, if any, comfort or usability.
<br>
<br>I got this for my partner as she has an older iPhone 13 and the battery health has deteriorated over the years to the point she is consistently in the 20% or lower range by the early afternoon from a full charge. The extra capacity lets her finish the day without worrying about missing communications from the office or having to use another device for web browsing or any other personal use.
<br>
<br>The only drawback has been situational, as this device doesn't have a kickstand like some other power banks. This hasn't proven to be a big issue thus far as it's rare for her to need to keep her phone in a vertical orientation while charging it, but I could see the utility in that feature. Also, the pink color is fairly muted in person, but it does allow you to quickly pick out the device from the sea of black and dark grey electronics that it's usually around or from the bottom of a bag.",是,5,Amazon Customer,2025-01-02

US,B0D7J24952,R1CFLLFUZ8HKCZ,“Pretty much perfect”,Color: Green,"I wanted some power banks to be more prepared for next hurricane season and I jumped on this when I saw a brand name I recognized. My husband claimed this one since it was a wireless MagSafe compatible product. He used it to charge his iPhone 16 Pro Max. With the power bank fully charged and his phone at 20%, it charged the phone to 70% in about one hour and then to 90% within another hour.
<br>
<br>It’s my understanding that it’s normal for power banks to charge quickly at first and then slower once the device you’re charging gets closer to 100%, so I’m not concerned that it took another hour to charge from 70% to 90%. This didn’t charge quite as quickly as the wired power bank I used, but that’s to be expected with wireless charging.

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R2EB3GS0CTN4VU,This a a review of Anker's CS response rathern than the actual product which was returned,Color: Black,"I have purchased Anker products before: battery packs, and wireless mouse etc, and have been generally happy with the products. Given this background history I was surprised and disappointed with Anker's response to query on their MagGo Power Bank. I have included my question to Anker and their response: My message to Anker "" On the Amazon website, the product is described as compatible with iPhone model 16, 15 etc but when I received the product, the information on the box indicates is is for iPhone 15/14/13/12 series....what about iPhone 16? Did I get an older model charger?
<br>Dec 23, 2024 10:50 PM
<br>The response from Anker : Dear George,
<br>I understand your concern about ensuring compatibility with your iPhone 16. Based on the information available, the Anker MagGo Power Banks, such as the A1610 Anker 621 Magnetic Battery (MagGo) and A1614 Anker 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo) Upgraded Version, are listed as compatible with iPhone 15/14/13/12 series.
<br>While the product box may not explicitly mention iPhone 16, it's possible that the MagGo series could still be compatible due to similar charging requirements across recent iPhone models. However, to be certain, you should check the output voltage and current of the power bank and ensure they match the requirements of your iPhone 16.
<br>If the specifications align, your MagGo Power Bank should work with your iPhone 16. If you have any doubts, it might be helpful to verify the specific model number of your power bank and compare it with the latest compatibility updates from Anker. "" Anker's response was surprisingly casual and NON-Professional : Particularly galling was their assertion and advise that "" While the product box may not explicitly mention iPhone 16, it's possible that the MagGo series could still be compatible ..."" The answer I expected was a clear yes or not on product compatibility with iPhone 16 rather than "" ...it is possible that the MagGo series could still be compatible"" Furthermore I was advised to "" ...to be certain, you should check the output voltage and current of the power bank and ensure they match the requirements of your iPhone 16."" Are your kidding?! the onus of checking product compatibility has now shifted to me, the consumer? I am very disappointed with Anker's response---instead of clear YES or NO answers on whether I received an outdated older model and product compatibility with iPhone 16, I was presented with the task of checking the output voltage and current of the product in question. The answer and solution Anker provided were ridiculous and non-professional. I am VERY disappointed with their quality of Customer Service.",是,1,GSheng,2024-12-30

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R1YY5X71ZDGJT,"Anker, y'all are slippin...",,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;I used to love Anker products, but somewhere along the line, someone within the company took a dump on product quality and just said, ""forget it.""
<br>
<br>I needed a new MagSafe power bank for on the go as my Apple one is great, but I needed a bit more of a charge, plus, USB C is real convenient. I've tried Anker's MagGo 10k power bank with the display, but it was too bulky, and way too slow to recharge, plus the heat that thing generated felt like Chernobyl was about to happen. I decided to give them another shot with this power bank, thinking they've worked out all the kinks. Nope. Anker needs to go back to the drawing board.
<br>
<br>First, I'm still not understanding how Anker has a power bank that is rated at 27,650mAh, can recharge with a 140w charger and be fully charged in under an hour, but it takes a 10k mAh about 2 hours to fully recharge.
<br>
<br>Second, I've had this power bank now for a little more than a week at the time of this review, and I liked it. It doesn't fast charge right away, it takes a minute for it to get there. Once it does, it'll go from 25% to 35% in an about 10 minutes or so (but that's also me leaving the phone alone too). Now wired is always better than wireless, and with that being said, plugging the PB w/ USB C into my iPhone 16 PM, and its fast charging without delay.
<br>
<br>Third, it lost some weight! Now, I'm not fat shaming, but its predecessor (w/ the display) was THICC! Forget jean pockets (too tight), and basketball shorts (too much swinging down below hits the twig and giggle berries). But this one, is just right. It fits comfortably in hand w/ the iPhone 16 PM. Plus, it doesn't get as hot, at least in my experience using it.
<br>
<br>Now, here we are, all excited thinking I've found the one. Then the problem comes up. It no longer wirelessly charges the phone. Tried my wife's phone, no. My kids phone, no. I tried charging it fully, I tried holding the button on the side for awhile, I looked at the manual again to see if there was a reset or something that mentions this issue. nothing. The charging indicator just blinks intermittently after putting the bank on the back of the phone. You get the animation, the chime, and the charging indication, but no movement on the battery percentage. It's going back. I might try a replacement, but it might be time to move onto another brand completely.

The battery will shut off if it gets too hot due to most phone's safety mechanisms. If you're passively using your phone throughout the day and want to stay topped up, this will do it for you.

<br>
<br>Despite that, this charger works really well. The charge lasts an entire week with periodic use, which is perfect for my needs. The magnet is impressively strong, and for reference, I use it with an iPhone 15.
<br>
<br>My main drawback is that it’s a bit cumbersome to use while holding my phone, it makes the phone feel heavy and uncomfortable to hold for long periods. I find it more convenient to use when I can prop up my phone instead of holding it.

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R3LL1H8PHN0YVJ,A Perfect Balance of Power and Portability,,"This MagSafe-compatible power bank offers the convenience of both wireless charging and charging via an included USB-C cable. Weighing 7.25 oz and measuring 4.09"" x 2.78"" x 0.58"", it strikes an ideal balance between battery capacity, form factor, and weight.
<br>
<br>The power bank itself can be charged quickly via the USB-C port at 30W and can charge an iPad Pro 11"" at around 29W. Thanks to its metal frame, the power bank only gets lukewarm during both charging and discharging, which is quite impressive. While I usually avoid wireless phone charging due to its lower efficiency, this power bank provides the flexibility to charge wirelessly when needed.
<br>
<br>The side that contacts the phone is slightly soft and rubbery, likely to protect the phone's back. However, it also tends to attract lint and dust particles, which can be somewhat difficult to remove. This minor downside is the only blemish on an otherwise perfect power bank.

<br>If you need a pack that can stay on your ohine in your pocket this is a good option, although it gets quite hot when fast charging at 15w.

<br>I'm very impressed with how long the battery lasts as I usually see my other 10k charger hit around the 30 to 40% mark when charging my phone from 10% (it shows the percentage instead of dots like this anker does) and this anker has 50% or more.

The only downside is that it is not a really fast charger but none of the magnetic chargers are. It is not very thick or heavy so having it attached to my phone isn't a big deal. I previously used a regular power bank connected via usb cable. This method charges very quickly but having the external battery hanging on by a cord was inconvenient.

<br>The only thing I kind of wish was different is the fact that it does weight more than other similar power banks I've used, but that isn't a deal breaker.

Exactly what I am looking for!",Color: Black,"I recently got the Anker MagSafe Battery Pack added to my everyday carry. I am a professional photographer so when I am on my day off I really want to carry light and have a more convenient gadget with me. This battery bank is exactly what I have been looking for.
<br>
<br>The build quality is top-notch. It feels solid and premium, and honestly, out of all the battery packs I’ve tried, this is my favorite so far.
<br>
<br>It’s slightly heavier than expected, but it’s slim enough to hold comfortably with one hand. I can still use my phone easily while it’s attached, which is a huge plus.
<br>
<br>Charging it up takes around 3 hours, which seems fair given its 10,000 mAh capacity. Once it’s full, it can charge my iPhone 15 Pro 2-3 times, making it awesome for a day out, a short road trip.
<br>
<br>The magnet on this thing is strong. It snaps right onto my iPhone and doesn’t budge, even when I’m walking or snapping photos. I feel completely confident holding my phone with the battery attached.
<br>
<br>One thing I noticed is it gets a bit warm while charging. When I used it to boost my iPhone from 5% to 70%, it heated up noticeably. It’s not alarming, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re using it for longer periods. The charging speed drops significantly once the phone reaches 70-80%, so I normally use it when my phone is under 20% to quickly boost my phone to 70%, which takes like 40 minutes.

US,B0D7DKJ75M,R3LIYO913TLZTH,Its great … but make sure you know this one thing,Color: Black,"PSA: If you are charging your phone from this battery via a wired USB-C connection while you also have the battery stuck to your phone via MagSafe, you will only get a ~15W charge rate, UNLESS you hold the button until the one LED turns off, which for some reason then allows it to deliver up to a 30W wired charge to your phone. I have no idea why, but I verified this via an in-line USB-C charging meter. While connected via USB-C only, it charged my phone at up to 30w. If I then attach the battery to my phone via MagSafe while still connected via USB-C, the charge rate drops to ~15W on the USB-C meter. If I detach the MagSafe connection, the USB-C meter remained at ~15W. I couldn’t get the 30W back unless I disconnect the USB-C cable and reconnect it. I just happened to notice that while charging at 15W over USB-C and the battery attached to the phone via MagSafe, when I held in the button on the battery until the one LED turned off, my USB-C meter immediately jumped to ~30W.

That doesn't sound like much until you're holding your phone for a while. Or have it on a lanyard on your neck or a wristlet while charging. Way too heavy. More disappointing is this ran so hot so fast, that the first time I put it on my phone within five minutes my phone told me to take it off that it was too hot. It was super hot to the touch.

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R2SCD7DGEAL6I9,Good but expensive,Color: White,"Anker is one of those manufacturers that is reasonably new on the consumer electronics scene (2011) but has had a big impact due to a focus on presentation, quality and function.
<br>
<br>This Anker MagGo Powerbank is no exception, supplied in a stout cardboard box, wrapped in a translucent plastic sleeve and, in appearance, very Apple.
<br>
<br>The Power Bank itself has a smart, rubberised charging surface with an aluminium band and a hard base. All nicely rounded. All very well made and seemingly invisibly assembled, not a screw fixing in sight.
<br>
<br>In use, it is as simple to use as it is good to look at. Charge the Power bank via a USB C port, then place whatever you wish to charge upon it. I am an Android person but my daughters iPhone 13 Pro was instantly recognised and instantly started to charge. Should you wish, you can also charge via the USB C port and supplied cable.
<br>
<br>If your iPhone has a non-magnetic case then this will charge through it but the attraction is weak. Take the case off and the magnetic attraction is reasonable, but again, compromised. Get a mag-safe case for full strength.
<br>
<br>This is a very nice power bank but there is huge competition. Anker have applied an 'Apple Tax' but I feel this misguided.

If you have a magsafe popsocket, or some other magsafe device, they would attach to the 622, but not this new version. 3) Charging is faster as you would expect, but NOT noticeably faster in our experience. In particular, during the early minutes of charging, you won’t look down and be surprised that your phone just gained +5%. Also, this unit is noticeably heavier than the 622… makes sense, you get double the battery, which could really help when you’re sharing the charger with others.

While it promises an ultra-slim design and powerful charging, this power bank has serious flaws that make it nearly unusable for day-to-day needs.
<br>
<br>Overheating Issues—Too Hot to Handle!
<br>The biggest problem? HEAT. Within minutes of charging, my iPhone displayed the dreaded ""Charging Paused"" message due to overheating. This isn’t just a one-off problem—it happens every time I use the MagGo, making it more of a hassle than a convenience. No one wants a power bank that can’t keep their phone charged without turning it into a mini heater. It’s supposed to keep my device alive, not cook it!
<br>
<br>Heavy and Bulky—Forget ""Ultra-Slim""
<br>Anker claims this power bank is ultra-slim, but in reality, it’s bulky and heavy. For something that’s meant to be portable and easy to carry, it feels like I’m lugging around a brick in my pocket. The magnetic attachment is a cool concept, but having that much weight hanging off the back of my phone makes it awkward to hold, and it’s definitely not comfortable for prolonged use. It’s marketed as sleek, but trust me—your wrists will feel the strain.
<br>
<br>Magnetic Strength Is Meh
<br>Speaking of the magnet, it’s just okay. It attaches to the back of my phone, but the connection feels weak and unreliable. I found myself constantly adjusting it because it doesn’t always align properly, which is frustrating when you’re trying to charge on the go. The magnet isn’t strong enough to stay in place if you’re moving around a lot, which defeats the whole purpose of a magnetic battery pack.
<br>
<br>Slow Charging—Where’s the Speed?
<br>At 15W, I expected decent charging speeds, but it feels sluggish compared to other power banks I’ve used. The slow charge combined with the overheating issue makes it a bad option for anyone who relies on their phone throughout the day. By the time it cools down enough to continue charging, I could’ve used a regular plug-in charger and been done twice as fast.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: A Painful Miss by Anker
<br>Overall, the Anker MagGo Power Bank is a major disappointment. Between the overheating, the bulk, and the weak magnet, it’s more of a burden than a reliable charging solution. If you’re looking for a power bank that delivers both portability and performance, I’d suggest looking elsewhere. This one just doesn’t live up to the Anker reputation or its promises.

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,RFPQPPY7ZPMGE,New Faster Wireless Charger,Color: White,"I almost bought an Anker wireless charger, but I figured I had enough chargers. But now that this model can do 15W wireless charging via the new Qi2 standard, it was a no-brainer.

<br>This is a relatively compact charger for a 10,000 mAh battery. It's also lightweight for its capacity. One side has a matte finish; the charging side has a mildly rubberized texture for grip along with MagSafe alignment.

<br>You can charge wirelessly at 15W, or you can connect a USB-C cable to physically charge at 30W. The choices are yours.

This means that my I can charge both my Iphone &amp; airpods without caring an extra cord around. It comes with a usb C to usb C connection, but you could also charge items that aren't usb C if you had the right cord for it. In addition, it charges through the same usb C connection that it uses for outputting power, which means no extra cords to carry around and you don't even need to switch the cord when charging.

The magsafe compatible magnet is strong and, unlike the 'alphabet' brands out there, it does provide a near 10,000mAh of power. Four pinpoint led lights indicate how much charge is remaining.

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R196Z3JIK067T1,"Fine, expensive, capable...",Color: White,"The cost of this is double several other chargers of similar capacity and capability as this one that I own. But it's Anker. It looks and feels premium in a way the others don't (and both are quite janky-looking after a year of use, in fact). In addition, it has Qi2 quick charging.
<br>
<br>Now, honestly, there are two things this charger has that I try to avoid in my other similar chargers. First, I don't like quick charging if I can avoid it because of the deleterious effect of quick charging over time on my iPhone's battery. It's nice to have the ability, but I try not to use it. I also try not to use wireless charging with these small battery packs because of the 10-20% decrease in charging efficiency. I try to eke out as much capacity as I can for my iPhone from little power banks, and thus prefer wired to wireless whenever possible. Still, it can be very handy to have this charger on my iPhone magnetically charging as I'm going about my day and I do use magnetic charging fairly often because, unlike quick charging, it only reduces the effective capacity of the battery pack because of the inefficiency of wireless. Once it's recharged the battery pack returns to full capacity and wireless charging and has no negative effect on the phone battery.
<br>
<br>Finally, one of my other two similar chargers has both a MagSafe connection for the iPhone and a MagSafe connection for my Apple Watch in the same unit. This lacks the Apple Watch charging pad. For the price, it would be nice if it had it, I feel.",否,5,Nebti19,2024-09-14

The size is very small for this capacity - about 4"" x 2.75"" x 9/16"". This one is will become my go to charger on the go and for travel. The design is very nice and when put together with the phone is the same width and doesn't block the camera lenses - and is not visible in wide angle mode.

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R2GI5UMN2AK08K,Hard to justify,Color: White,"A solid performer from Anker that performs exactly as advertised and biased towards the iPhone. The nice thing here is the honesty from anker on the power banks performance. Many don’t realise that the capacity’s quoted by power bank manufacturers is only the battery capacity inside and not what you can actually use. This is because battery charging is not exactly efficient with a good rule of thumb being 0.6 x the capacity being available.
<br>Still here it’s all laid to bare on the side of the power bank and good for Anker in doing so. The bank is well made having a solid feel and weight behind it. The magnetic interface works perfectly working as soon as you attach it to the phone. The details say it’s iPhone only but in all honesty this will charge any Qi certified wireless charging device it’s just a matter of lining up. Of course if your device doesn’t have a magnetic interface it won’t stick to it like it does for the iPhone. Once placed on the phone it’s not going anywhere and this is perfect for day to day use being so slim. It has a USB c connection for charging/recharging so you can still charge the traditional way.

<br>First off, it is advertised as Slim or Ultra-Slim; it is still about the same size as typical third-party power banks at about 9/16"" thick, but that is actually pretty slim considering it packs 10,000mAh in comparison to the typical 5,000mAh.

<br>You do though get the Anker brand, and the 24 month warranty is reassuring.",否,4,mistermuttley,2024-09-10
US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R3OO5CBV5EFMDZ,"As a battery brick and a USB output, it works with anything that also has that available.",Color: White,"I have a couple of things which can use magnetic charging, like my watch, but it doesn't work with this brick and magnetic charging - but I do not care, because it rapidly charged up my watch by simply using the little USB wire that came with the watch - and bingo - it works!
<br>
<br>I love these little bricks, they charge things very effectively and efficiently, and I don't require the magnetic aspects of it, but because it has a magnet, I can just stick it to the metal shelves next to my desk, but normally, I kind of keep them in a battery brick drawer to have them handy.
<br>
<br>I also rotate them around so that I am not depleting the same brick all the time, so I rotate them around, and if I have not been using them as much, I check on them to top them off and be ready to go about every week or two... and I top off any battery just prior to going on a video shoot. I might prefer to have ""plug in power"" for everything, but the batteries allow me to charge up other items (microphones and receivers), or even run some equipment (I have larger battery bricks for that!).
<br>
<br>Excellent little battery brick, very sleek, great design, seems to charge things up quickly!

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R1NXRTIX2R3IUE,"Great design, nice bang for the buck",Color: White,"It's amazing how much companies have figured out how to compress power cells these days. I've got a 10K charger from just a few years ago that's got to be 2.5x as thick and 3 times as heavy as this one.
<br>
<br>Anyhow, this thing has everything you need. It's portable, it's light, it rebuilds its charge in a reasonable fast manner, and it delivers clean, even power to connected devices efficiently. I hooked it up to a sensor and detected no variations in delivery.
<br>
<br>This, to me, represents the perfect intersection of power, performance, and value.",否,5,L,2024-09-09
US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R3KGZ5K4EF5BPJ,"Looks good, works well. A very decent, Premium quality, power bank",Color: White,"The powerbank arrives in premium packaging. Much akin to an Apple product.
<br>
<br>Upon opening the packaging the powerbank that greets you is compact - though quite weighty - and it look of premium quality straight away. The White glass effect body coupled with the steel side bodywork is again akin to what you would expect from an Apple product. Impressive.
<br>
<br>The only button is one small steel button on the side which when pressed shows how much charge is in the paowerpack. This is shown by how many of the white dots at the bottom are illuminated.
<br>
<br>It arrived with 3 white dots of power so I fully charged it. Then once full I used it to charge my iPhone 15 which went from 68% to 94% in 39 mins.
<br>
<br>The Magsafe magnet of this powerbank is quite strong but my phone did move a little at the bottom on the power pack , so just be careful here. And yes once attached to my phone it did make my phone quite weighty. But what do you expect from a 10,000 mAh powerbank? I have other 10,000 mAh powerbanks that weigh a good bit more than this Anker powerbank and unlike this one, they look like plastic bricks.
<br>
<br>All in all a classy looking powerbank that works well and is a perfect companion for your iPhone/Smartphone.
<br>
<br>So why only 4 stars and not 5? Well thats because I think that even for the quality item that its is, the price of £69.99 is excessive. If you can buy it when a decent offer is on (maybe nearer £50 or less) then I would absolutely say go for it but at Seventy Quid, perhaps do your research on others first before paying such a high sum.",否,4,Shane,2024-09-09

US,B0D7HZ4G5G,R3GN25TLDGALMO,Perfect!,Color:White,So happy with how small it is for 10k mAh. All the capacity and phenomenal packaging. Exactly what you need and nothing extra. Returned the 10k one with the oled screen for this one. So much better because it’s so much smaller.,是,5,Robert F.,2024-09-08
