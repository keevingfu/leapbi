US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R2O6D7JF379HDQ,Love the Size!,Color: Black Stone,"We bought this thinking it would be great for travel, and I'm sure it will be, but it's already become our primary charger in our family room. It's great to be able to fold it up and leave it on the coffee table without it taking up a lot of space or looking out of place. In use, it charges quickly and works great with our Apple devices (watch and iPhone) and a Samsung Z Flip phone.",是,5,Holly,2025-03-08
US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R2MMIEY7XZHT87,Honestly? This Anker MagGo UFO Charger is a Game-Changer!,Color: Aurora White,"Just grabbed this Anker MagGo UFO charger last month and wow - where has this been all my life? If you're sick of dealing with charging cable chaos (like I was), this thing is a total lifesaver.
<br>
<br>The magnetic snap for my iPhone is super satisfying, and it actually charges FAST (15W is no joke). I can finally charge my phone, watch and AirPods all at once without playing ""find the cable"" at 11pm.
<br>
<br>Best part? It folds up tiny for travel! I used to pack this whole tangle of chargers when traveling, but now it's just this little UFO-looking thing and I'm good to go. So much extra space in my bag now.
<br>
<br>Just a heads up - you do need to keep it plugged in (it's not a power bank), but that's obvious from the description.
<br>If you've got an iPhone and other Apple stuff, seriously just buy this already. Your nightstand (and your sanity) will thank you!
<br>
<br>If you are trying to cut weight and cables in your carry on give this a look.",是,5,The Retired Travelers,2025-03-08

I sued it for my travel to Spain and the cruise, and it save me a lot of space. And its very compact as well.

<br>
<br>It is worth noting that the charging 3-in-1 accessory does need a USB-C cable, which is included, and it also comes with a small brick to plug-in as well. Personally, I bring a different charging brick since the one included only has one port, so I can charge something else as well such as laptop.

US,B0D8PYWHZR,R14LTYSB0MRW3U,This charger is worth 5 Stars,Color: Black Stone,"We've used many iPhone/Watch chargers over the years, with the majority being either 'just ok', or 'its going back'. My criteria is :
<br>
<br>1. how quickly and easily can I place an iPhone to activate the charger
<br>2. does it charge through our iPhone cases
<br>3. is it easy to stow in my carry-on
<br>4. is it quick to set up while travelling
<br>5. ideally can it charge 2 phones and a watch
<br>
<br>It's not as important how long it takes to charge, as we do our charging at night and expect the device battery to get us through 1 day.
<br>
<br>The UFO checks all the boxes. I've NEVER had to play with a phone or watch to get it to charge, it's ridiculously small but effective for travel, and the center non-Magsafe charger is very easy to place a 2nd phone for charging. It even charges the watch and Magsafe at very high wattage.

US,B0D8PYL8CS,R167UQYNXE3DQT,"Not a wireless base, must be plugged in",Color: Pink Aura,"When I originally ordered this, I thought it was a ""chargeable charger."" Meaning, you could charge the UFO base and take it with you as a ""wireless charger."" It is NOT. That's not to say that it's not amazing and super easy to travel with. The other reviews do it justice as far as being a great charger.
<br>
<br>It would be nice to have a pouch to carry all three pieces, but I did find that there are cases specifically made for this. However, I did buy it thinking that I could charge on the go without carrying the cord and outlet brick (like the lady in the photos putting only the UFO in her pocket). I just wanted to clear that up in case anyone else thought ""wireless"" meant completely wireless.
<br>
<br>It's a little expensive for what it is. I agree with the other reviewers that it probably should be about $50. If you could charge the base, and travel with just the ""UFO"" by itself even for a few hours, it might justify this price.",是,4,Leverette515,2025-01-12

US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R1KE3JH208GW7S,"Elegant travel solution for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods",,"Long story short, the Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo UFO 3-in-1 Charger is a compact and elegant charging solution that has simplified my travel gear, reducing friction and viscosity for my overall travel experience. It's a little pricey, but worth it for the convenience, space-saving, and performance.
<br>
<br>I'm the guy responsible for power delivery for all of the devices on family trips (two adults and two older teens with loads of Apple devices), and I normally have a hefty tech bag full of chargers and cables of all varieties to ensure everyone can keep everything charged. Hotels can be tough with a limited number of outlets, many of which are loose from extensive use, so ensuring all devices can be charged involves either bringing portable plug strips, multi-port chargers, and several duplicates of lightning, USB-C, and Apple Watch pucks to ensure all devices are able to charge, especially at night. It all works, but it is an unsightly mess of cables taking up a fair amount of limited horizontal space.
<br>
<br>I had known about the Anker 3-in-1 system (and others like it), but I had irrationally resisted picking one up due to the relatively high price, and the fact that I had an inelegant but functional alternative. Fortunately for me, my wife decided to purchase two of these as xmas gifts for me and for herself, and we were able to put them to use right away on a holiday trip.
<br>
<br>No surprise, this is a MUCH cleaner and space saving charging solution that leaves plenty of room on the nightstand for other items. The charging is plenty fast with Qi2 for iPhone and 15W charging for Apple Watch (AirPod charging seemed to work fine, too, but I haven't speed-tested this feature from a low charge). Everything stays cool to the touch while charging, which is not the case with all Qi or Qi2 chargers I have used. The charger folds up into a clever and convenient little bundle, and it fits nicely in my travel tech pouches. The included 40W USB-C adapter is decently compact with folding plugs, and it is also perfectly useable to charge my MacBook Air 15"" when needed.
<br>
<br>I'll echo the sentiment of some of the other reviews that suggested that a small carrying bag or pouch would be a nice addition, but there are plenty of inexpensive 3rd party options that would work fine. Personally I use a folding tech pouch with plenty of spaces to pack the charger, adapter, and cable. The folded up charger is a little on the thick side (1.4""), but I have plenty of charging adapters that are equally thick, so it's not a problem to find appropriate spaces.
<br>
<br>I already have another charging system for my nightstand at home, but one could certainly use this as an every-day charger if you are on a budget or don't want duplicate gear. Personally I would chose a dedicated home charging station (Anker makes a few, and there are many others), rather than one optimized for travel.
<br>
<br>On the price, that's always going to be a personal judgment. I was somewhat reluctant, but fortunately my wife got us over the hump, and in retrospect I think it was well worthwhile for the convenience and elegance of the compact, simple, clean solution.
<br>
<br>Finally regarding the brand, I have had very good experiences with all the Anker products I have purchased over the years (cables, charging adapters, power banks, usb hubs), so I anticipate few if any problems with this charger, and good customer service if ever needed.",是,5,Alan Fry,2025-01-01

This works well for me having a quick plug in the wall, drop the personal and business phone down with the watch at the end of the day and forget about it.
<br>
<br>Quality feels alright, I was hoping for a slightly sturdier fit and finish, but the product works. A lot lighter than I expected.
<br>
<br>For convenience, this is where it’s at and I think it’s one of Anker’s best products for the traveler. One plug, one cord, instead of two or three plugs and three cords.
<br>
<br>The next question and perhaps I’ll update the review later, but I with my experience with Anker products, they don’t fail fast. I have a feeling a new and improved version, or this one will be discontinued by the time it stops working. Who knows.
<br>
<br>This would make a great gift for someone traveling often for work too. From experience with third-party products, this might be on the steep side nearing $100, but if you settle for less it will fail or defect, or cause major issues with your phone degrading the battery quicker.

<br>This thing better last long.
<br>It does the job well- I leave my stuff on it overnight and everything is charged. Just be mindful of placement. The magnet is so strong that if you pick up ur phone in the night it’s taking the whole unit with it and your AirPods and phone will fall off or no longer be positioned correctly to charge. I’m not sure what Anker could have done to resolve this. I just know don’t touch my phone at night. I do wish there was a way to position the phone so I could at least see the time. As for heat, I didn’t really notice anything major (iPhone 15pro max).
<br>I do wish the charging block was smaller. At least they made the prongs fold in (unlike the other Qi2 travel charger). For the price (over $70) Anker should have included a carrying case.",是,5,Angie,2024-11-22

It may have something to do with the wattage in different countries, not sure. Still I like it for travel for its convenience, but I will use an adapter with a lower wattage so it won't heat up so much. I don't need fast charging as I charge my devices overnight anyway.

This charger supports the latest technology which will charge my phone with Qi2 at 15 watts. It also charges my Apple watch Ultra at the same speed as the charger that came in the box. It is important to note that ever Apple watch charger claims ""Fast Charging"" but ones that support fast charging on the Series 7 and later are fundamentally different and charge about twice as fast.
<br>
<br>I also appreciate that I can charge my Air Pods wirelessly at the same time. In reality, I'd be good with only two of the chargers since my Air Pods can charge on the watch and phone chargers but it is nice to have the ability charge all 3 at the same time.

I know a few other reviews commented on the blinking light. The light should not blink continuously. If it does, make sure you use the included adapter or another adapter with a 40w output. I found this out with a lower watt adapter that I bought so I wouldn't have to unplug it for travel. Just take another with me. If the light blinks with the included adapter, just unplug and replug. It should go out. It happens if the power output drops. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this charger.",是,4,Sharon Jean Eastridge,2024-11-10

US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R1BEYOYNGGFM5W,Super Compact & Fast Charging Station,Color: Teal Oasis,"I selected the Anker MagGo UFO 3-1 Charging station because of my previous experience with the Anker brand and this charging station does not disappoint. First, I must acknowledge the price was higher than I expected, but after receiving and using the charging station, I believe Anker charging station performance matches its price point. As noted, this device is NOT a battery.
<br>
<br>Let me start with the size of the Anker MagGo UFO 3-1 Charging station. When collapsed, it literally fits in the palm of my hand and in a small pocket in my backpack. The flat cables connecting each charging location is made of silicone which appears to be very durable. The magnets are strong enough to hold each device on the charging port.
<br>
<br>From a performance standpoint, the surprise and standout feature was the speed that my Apple Series 9 Watch charged. The Anker UFO charging station has become my primary charging location for my Apple watch. Less time on the charger means more time on my wrist. I utilize my Apple watch for various medical reasons and it is important for me to have my watch on my wrist as much as possible.
<br>
<br>Overall, I am a fan of fewer wires and fast charging. Devices are meant to be used not placed on chargers. The Anker brand has made another great product and I remain an (unpaid) advocate for this brand.

I found this new 3-in-1 from Anker and am really impressed. My phone recharges at a good speed, and I can also charge my AirPods Pro and Apple Watch Ultra at the same time. Do I usually need the ability to charge both my phone and AirPods at the same time? Probably not, but it's a good option to have if I've gone on too long watching videos and both need to recharge. The form factor is really nice and can fit into almost any charging carry bag. It included the needed cable and adapter - coming with an adapter is uncommon these days, even the expensive MagSafe Duo, so having this was a definitely a pro.

US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R31UF9SESRBC4F,Great solution for travel charging,Color: Teal Oasis,"I am on the road for business travel a lot, and this tool is super useful for an all-in-one solution. I am heavily in the Apple ecosystem, so I have an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. This 3-in-1 allows me to charge my devices at the same time. The charger is durable and conveniently folds up into a tiny UFO-like structure. Wireless charging is not as fast as wired, but most of the time I find myself only charging my phone at night. This is great for overnight charging at a hotel; you truly do not need any other cables.

US,B0D8PYL8CS,R6R7707MY3LFG,Tiny charging 3-in1 Charging Package.,Color: Pink Aura,"I have always found Anker to be a reputable brand that makes durable products. This MagGo UFO 3-in-1 Charge is incredible. It is so compact and comes with everything you need to charge an iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. There is a 40w power adapter and 5ft (1.5m) USB-C to USB-C cable.
<br>
<br>This is NOT a power bank. This needs to be plugged in so that it can charge your devices. The package lists the following output for charging:
<br>
<br>Total Wattage: 25W
<br>
<br>iPhone: 15W Max
<br>Apple Watch: 5W Max
<br>TWS: 5W Max

US,B0D8PYL8CS,RBFCJFKBX0KRW,Very expensive for what it does,Color: Pink Aura,"The Anker MagGo UFO 3-in-1 Charger is definitely on the higher end compared to other 3-in-1 chargers I own, which typically range from $20 to $50. This one costs about twice as much, so I was curious to see if the difference was justified. Upon unboxing, the quality was impressive: exactly what you'd expect from Anker. The silicone connections between the three different charging pads were actually better than I anticipated, giving it a durable and premium feel.
<br>
<br>However, when it came to charging performance, I was slightly disappointed. While the device claims to support 15W charging, I only managed to get 10W at most, even though I was using a 65W adapter. So, I know my charger wasn't the issue.
<br>
<br>All in all, it's a solid charging station, and I love the foldable design for travel. But considering the higher price, I've had very similar results with other brands at a fraction of the cost. If you're looking for a high-quality, portable charger and trust Anker’s build, it might be worth the extra investment, but don’t expect drastically faster charging.",否,4,Nate,2024-10-21
US,B0D8PYL8CS,R16TQ7T9I4HR3Z,"It's not a question of quality, but of value",Color: Pink Aura,"So this 3 in 1 charger is notable ultra portable. I mean this thing is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand and the charger itself feels durable. The chargers have a nice rubberized surface which makes for a satisfying connection and prevents your devices from sliding around. For travel, I'm excited to be able to pack this, a cable, and a charging brick (of which it comes with both) and call it a day. So the only question is, what is something like this worth to you? How much do you value portability, reliability, and a ""complete"" solution?
<br>
<br>So if I were to break this down, you could technically get 3 in 1 chargers for around $50. Which isn't nothing, but it's cheaper. The main differences I've found are that this does come with a 40w charging brick. I've seen others not include one or include a lower wattage. For a 40w adapter, that's around $10-$20 depending on what you're buying. Does this charge as fast as plugging in my standard watch cable or Apple branded magsafe? Not quite. But the convenience of having all 3 built into one is super nice. It also includes a USB c cable. That's another $10-$15 of the cost. So there's certainly value in this bundle, but for me, really, it's about the quality and the customer service. Anytime I've had an issue with an Anker product, they're quick to respond and resolve the issue. I've yet to have any catastrophic problems with any of their products which builds some trust. It may not be the fastest charger, but I also don't feel like it's going to melt my devices. Which is a huge plus from me!",否,5,Peter Q.,2024-10-18

I use a white noise app (just sound, no display) and the charger was only able to maintain the battery (went to bed and woke up with the battery around 60%). And this was with only the iPhone on the charger (no AirPods or watch). I was able to work around this by charging while getting ready and driving in to the job.

US,B0D8PYPJ8P,R19U8OFK66GU7P,A great all-in-one charger,Color: Teal Oasis,"I have a MagSafe Duo from Apple. It was great when it was new, but I no longer have any devices with Lightning and I wanted something that could charge my iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 10, and earbuds with Qi charging. Anker usually makes solid products so I decided to try this.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a solid upgrade over the MagSafe Duo. The Qi2 magnetic charger is fully MagSafe compatible and I get the animation on my iPhone when it's attached. The magnets are strong and pull the charger to the iPhone. The middle Qi charger works well and charges my JBL Tour Pro 3 earbuds without problems. Lastly, the Apple Watch section has magnets that feel as strong as Apple's.
<br>
<br>Every section charges at full speed. Anker includes a 40W wall plug with folding prongs and a USB-C output. They also include a 5ft cable, I wish it was longer at 6-9ft, but 5ft is better than the paltry length Apple included with the MagSafe Duo. The cable is a basic USB-C to USB-C one, nothing special about it. But it is included. The 40W wall plug is smaller than Apple's 20W one, even with the prongs unfolded. The folding prongs are a nice touch though and make this a nice travel package.
<br>
<br>The UFO charger folds into a small package. It's about the size of the case for my earbuds and the wall plug. I'm not used to having a charging station for all my devices, and this one is easy to recommend. The benefit of the 40W plug is that I can use it to charge my iPad Pro. A 45W plug would have really sealed the deal. I could use it to charge my Stem Deck, my wife could use it for her MacBook Air, and I could charge my MacBook Pro with the lid closed.
<br>
<br>Still, this is a solid travel package that I won't go on a trip without. It folds up along with its plug and fits into a small compartment in my backpack.",否,5,This Is Not,2024-10-14

<br>
<br>AND it’s Qi2, so my iPhone 15 Pro Max is getting a 15W fast charge from it! It’s honestly hard not to love, though there are some considerations that might make this not the best for everyone.
<br>
<br>First: everything lays flat so it’s not exactly practical if you can’t lay your watch band flat or need it for special viewing. That’s why I think it’s best as a travel companion: because it’s really minimalist and portable, even if you don’t get the best viewing angles from it.
<br>
<br>Second: the AirPods pick is, at least for my AirPods Pro 2 in a MagSafe case, not something that really holds onto the AirPods (the magnetic attraction is weak or non-existent). This is usually the case with most AirPods charging pads, so it’s not anything worse than that. And because it’s laying flat, it really doesn’t matter all that much.
<br>
<br>Otherwise: it’s just a great, compact 3-in-1. Hope this helps!",否,5,Jay Aaron,2024-10-12

So far, I've found the Anker MagGo UFO charger to hit all three goals beautifully! Like many accessories I've tried from Anker, this charger feels like a premium product and contains plenty of device-protection features and safety certifications (according to the documentation + website). Just as the product images show from Anker, the unit can snap together and become portable easily and securely! One item that would have been amazing would be a carrying case for the cable and charger, but hopefully those will start popping up around Amazon shortly. I charged an iPhone 13 Pro, AirPods Pro (2nd gen), and Apple Watch S8 without issue - all appear to be charging quite rapidly.

It comes in a small package, and comes with a nice 40 watt adapter that supports a ton of voltage profiles, unlike a lot of the anker offerings. A lot of the anker power adapters, especially the ones designed to be less expensive, usually only support 5v and 9v profiles, leaving any device that doesn't use that profile to be stuck with the 5v base profile.
<br>
<br>The included wall brick supports 40 watts, 5v, 9v, 12v, 15v and 20v and is TUV certified. I do wish it was ETL or UL listed, but TUV will work fine as well.
<br>
<br>The unit itself supports 12v 3a, 15 v 2.66a and 9v 3a so you can also power the puck with a different charger as long as it meets minimum specs in case you want to bring a multiport adapter or use a power bank.
<br>
<br>I do with the charger itself was certified by TUV or someone else, but I trust anker enough that they are likely supporting quality builds anyway.
<br>
<br>The form factor is nice, because since I don't sleep with my watch on, I can use this to charge my watch and then use nightstand mode as I sleep by flipping it over and attaching the watch puck to the back. Other similar devices make it so you have to leave the phone flat and I am not a fan of that design.
<br>
<br>It does have an indicator light, and I am happy to report that it doesn't seem to stay on and blind you while you sleep. The only real improvement I could see is it could come with a small pouch to make the travel friendly design even friendlier, and possibly a power adapter that includes international adapters like some brands include, like Satechi.

I leave it in my backpack full time now, and also ordered one for my wife. Excellent product!",是,5,Brian,2024-09-23

US,B0D8PTGKSM,R2E8FQW5FG1P46,Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo UFO 3-in-1 Charger,Color: White,"I had seen a YouTuber promote this and thought the idea was great. A very travel friendly device for all my Apple devices. This is super light and folds itself together and stays together with magnets. I love how light it is; I’ve been using it as my couch charger because I can hold onto my phone and do stuff while it’s attached. It charges everything up really well, my watch charged up like it would on my normal next to the bed charger (it took the same amount of time). Since it is just USB C, you can take it anywhere and as long as you’ve got access to a USB C you’ve got the ability to charge three things at once. You can even use the middle circle for AirPods for an older iPhone without magsafe (or with magsafe). I have an iPhone 15 PRO MAX and my kiddo uses an iPhone 12 PRO MAX and I can use the magsafe charger and he can use the AirPods charger. Overall this is a nice new addition to Anker’s MagSafe lineup - in my opinion!",否,5,Amanda G,2024-09-23

US,B0D8PTGKSM,R2P20ZPP1CL3HO,"Expensive, but small, interesting overall design.",Color: White,"I am always looking for a way to reduce the size, number and weight of things I carry in my briefcase. The Anker MagSafe charger fits these needs. It is light, but not cheap, it is a smaller size than other 3 in one chargers and it charges well.
<br>
<br>The only issue, and the reason for the 4 start review is the design of the device. I got a white device because I have found it harder to leave behind in an office of hotel room. For many, the design will seem innovative consisting of two cookies staked on top of each other. The smaller cookie not he top is the Apple Watch charger, the lower and larger cookie splits in half for the cell phone and air buds charger. So far so good.
<br>
<br>The issue that i have is that the design makes the MagGo charger resemble the “po p’ emoji. It’s less obvious in white and help them if they offer a brown color version, or perhaps they should.",否,4,Mark P. McDonald,2024-09-23

US,B0D8PTGKSM,RIBMPXGOVCCPC,Amazing and fast charger,Color: White,"I've been rocking Apple's MagSafe Duo for years now, swapping out my iPhone and my AirPods Pro, and I think this is the spiritual successor.
<br>
<br>It's FAST. I was shocked at how fast my Apple Watch 6 charged on it the first morning I tried it out. The Qi2 pad also lined up with my iPhone quickly and charged it efficiently, and AirPods Pro, of course, also charged about as fast as they ever have.
<br>
<br>I know some folks have been reporting experiences not being able to run this off some USB-C power supplies—I'd bet there are some incompatibilities regarding Power Delivery capabilities. For my part, it's worked great with everything I've plugged it into. Its home is an Anker power strip with dual USB-A and C ports, taking one of the C ports. (I haven't even bothered trying a USB-A-to-C cable, of course—there's no way that would work!) But it's also a really nice brick they've included; you can never have too many good-quality USB-C bricks.
<br>
<br>Now my only question is… do I leave this on my desk at work and take the Duo with me? Or the other way around? Decisions, decisions…",否,5,Amazon Customer,2024-09-21

US,B0D8PYWHZR,RJ3DEXHSWX6JY,OK Charger and Must Use a Power Brick,Color: Black,"This review is for Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo UFO 3-in-1 Charger, iPhone 16 Wireless Charger Station, Qi2 Certified 15W, Foldable Travel Charging Pad, for iPhone 15/14/13/12, AirPods, Apple Watch (Not a Power Bank). I love the small size of this 3-in-1 charger and it works fine for my devices. I have an iPhone SE 2 now and it charges it fine. The charging rate for my Apple Watch 2 and Airpods 3 was also acceptable but not great. In order to test this item correctly, I did use their cable and adapter and not ones that I already have to ensure accuracy. I was able to charge all of my devices (iPhone SE 2, Watch 5, and AirPods 3) singly and simultaneously without any issues. The rates I got were OK and about the same as several cheaper chargers that I have tested, which was kind of surprising to me (see pix). I didn’t quite get 15W (iPhone ~ 6W), 5W (Watch ~2.3W) and 5W (AirPods ~2.1W) promised for each device but at this point, I don’t know if my devices are controlling the charging speed or if the charger itself isn’t as capable (see pix). I’ve seen better numbers from other no brand name chargers so it's hard to say. The cheaper chargers I’ve tested usually show about 12W, 2W and 2W respectively. Even though I don’t have a MagSafe phone, using this type of charger has never been an issue for me with either my old iPhone X or SE 2. I also found that a power brick must be used with this charger. Any power brick seems to work though. This means I can’t just take one end of the cord and plug it into a USB-C outlet on the wall or on my power strip because it won’t charge at all, so this was another surprise for me. I thought I would just get a lower charging rate instead of zero charging. Overall, I like the small size profile of the charger but I found that my cheaper chargers seem to work better and some actually allowed me to use my USB-C outlet without needing the power brick. It’s OK and maybe once I get my MagSafe phone to test again, I might see higher numbers. However, this has never been an issue for me testing all other chargers. For now, I would give it a 3.8/5.0 - 09/20/2024.",否,4,Gianni Breck,2024-09-20
US,B0D8PTGKSM,R3066S3T853ENG,Smallest three device charger,Color: White,"Now that I am retired, I find I am traveling about as much as I did when I was working - in fact more than that. I am on the road about a third of the time. I still carry a bunch of devices with me that need recharging, so I have been checking out a few different multi-device chargers that promise to help me reduce the amount of cords, charging devices and power supplies I need to carry.
<br>
<br>I've uploaded some photos that show the progression of devices I have acquired. I am not showing my stuff being charged because they all work about as well for that and, well, that is boring. I think what you might want to know is which one is the smallest. The answer is that this new Anker device is the smallest when folded up and second smallest when deployed. My view of ""smallest"" when deployed is which one takes up the least area on my nightstand or desk. Although space is at its highest premium when staying in a non-luxury hotel or on a cruise ship (because, retiree), I'm choosing the Anker as my ""go-to"" charger for travel since it takes up the least space in my baggage, while still being of robust construction and working well.
<br>
<br>Note that I do not picture the excellent little wall wart and cable that the unit comes with. For me personally, it is all about the charger itself since I use a multi-port GaN based charger to power up my MacBook Pro 14"" (M2), iPad Pro and this unit all at one time. The reduced power consumption from these devices plus USB-C makes all this possible to connect this way. This reduces my travel power kit to my multiport charger, three USB-C cables and this little flying saucer. Neat! The weight loss by going this way (lead by swapping the larger single port Apple laptop charger) and getting rid of the extra cables and adapters adds up to about 1.5lbs and significant space and clutter reduction.
<br>
<br>One extra credit point for this gadget is that the status light is not obnoxiously bright or persistent. It is easily visible and only really turns on to let you know the device is connected to power. It then goes off so you don't have a searchlight coming off your nightstand when you are in bed. It is really well thought out.
<br>
<br>Lastly, Anker has been a ""go-to"" brand for me lately. I have power banks, cables, chargers, etc. They have all been my most reliable and robust gear. I'm looking forward to many road trips with this spacey little charger.",否,5,P. MSakamoto,2024-09-18

<br>I have purchased Anker products before and have been satisfied with their products so I wasn't surprised when I received and used this. This works exactly as advertised and in fact exceeded my expectation. I love the compact size of this charger, and I can charge my phone, case and watch all at one time using one device.

US,B0D8PTGKSM,R3NSCFE9EYQFFY,Complete failure; does not charge,Color: White,"Such a disappointment. I'm a huge Anker fan, and all of my chargers, powerbanks, cables and cords are Anker. I've always had great luck with them and with their customer service but this MagGo UFO 3 in 1 charger is a complete failure.
<br>
<br>It came in quality packaging, with Apple style tabs to pull to open the nice, square, hard sided box, rather than those sticky labels that are normally used to close packaging. It also includes a charging cable and a fast wall charger. I was impressed up to this point. But then...
<br>
<br>I plugged the charger in to get it to a full charge, and waited..and waited...and waited. 24 hours later, the bright light on it continued to blink, indicating it was still charging. I opened the charger up and put my iPhone 15 Pro Max and my Apple Watch on it - and nothing. Nada. Zip. They clicked on the chargers, so the connection was working, but they did not charge at all. No green charging indicator, nothing.
<br>
<br>So disappointing - I was planning on using this on an upcoming trip - in three days- and was pleased to have found a lightweight, small portable charger for the trip. Now I'm going to be using my heavy Anker Powerbank on the plane, and have to go to the inconvenience of packing this back up and returning it to the UPS store to ship it back to Anker.

So far charges and works just as described. Nice bonus is you can use it in landscape mode to watch video while it’s charging. Since the watch charger is tethered with the silicone band, no worries about having a band that doesn’t split apart just loop it over the watch charger and it works fine! My Ultra Watch fits perfect with an old Milanese band and even functions in nitetime mode.
